President #Duterte also directed Bello to ensure that only students who had the drive to finish their studies would avail of the education subsidy.

Sa daming Squatters sa buong Pilipinas sa Metro Manila pa lang ang dami kakayanin kaya ni Manny Pacquiao na bigyan ng disenteng bahay ang mga ito sa loob lamang ng 3 - 4 months. Kahit ano pa propaganda mo Manny hindi parin kita iboboto kasi imposible yang pinapangarap mo.
Kaya hindi niyo mapabagsak ang isang duterte sapagkat naging tapat siya sa paglilingkod sa diyos at sa tao. Kaya siya nanatili sa pwesto sapagkat nasa sa kanya ang pagpapala ng diyos. Alam ng diyos ang katotohanan kaya kayo hindi nagtatagumpay kasi alam niya na madumi kayo.
Makahulugan ang tinuran noon ni Hesus sa mga Hudyo laban sa isang Maria Magdalena bago ka mag malinis siguraduhin mo muna na wala kang bahid dungis o pagkakasala bago mo batuhin ang isang tao. Make it sure na wala kang nagawang pagkakamali sa sarili mo. Kaya kayong Oposisyon.
Ito para sa mga nagmamalinis na taga Oposisyon. This biblical quote from Jesus. Si Magdalena inakusahan na isang maduming babae sa panahon ni Hesus at nais nila parusahan thru stone throw. Pero ano sinagot sa kanila ni Hesus sige mauna nang bumato ang malinis at walang bahid.
"@CDeplorable Almost 10,000 miles."
Kung maka bato kayo ng putik sa pangulo akala niyo malinis kayo at walang bahid pagdududa. Anong sabi noon ni Jesus sa mga taong nag aakusa kay Maria Magdalena na madumi daw siyang babae pero ano sagot ni Hesus sa kanila. Sige kung sino sa inyo ang walang bahid pagkakasala mauna.

"@Doc4Dead If his president wins the election, the president will step down so  duterte will be president. Then, 2028, he will run as VP again because he is qualified for reelection, and if he wins again, his president will again step down and he will be the president again."
The only good thing about #pacquiao is that he is not #Duterte. Otherwise why would you vote someone so unqualified to be president. Si Digong nga supposedly qualified pero kita naman gaano sya kawalang kwenta.

Kapag dilawang gawang mga batas depektibo tulad nitong 1987 Constitution tapos yung batas na pinasa ni Senador Kiko Pangilinan na Juvenile Law na kung saan below 18 hindi maaaring makulong. Kaya maraming mga kabataan ang nagagamit ng mga sindikato kasi wala namang parusang kulong
Ang 1987 Constitution ay depektibo. Bakit? Unang una imagine mo ang Pangulo maaaring tumakbo bilang bise presidente. Klaro lang ang nakalagay dun ay re-election lang pinagbabawal. So it means si PRRD hindi pwedeng tumakbo bilang Pangulo but in Vice President pwede siya.
