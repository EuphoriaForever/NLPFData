I was very wrong a few weeks ago when I called Joe Biden “Jimmy Carter 2.0.”   He’s so much worse and I’m sorry to have even associated a good man but a terrible leader with Joe Biden and his disastrous presidency.
We forfeited any leverage we had with this administration’s ridiculous actions. You don’t give the enemy everything the could possibly hope for and more then start negotiations. That’s not how leverage works.

Just when you think the Joe Biden and his Administration couldn't get any lower.   What an absolute disgrace.
The Biden administration didn’t just abandon Americans in Afghanistan. They even abandoned hard-working service dogs!!! WTF

Notice the media reaction to this national disgrace is nothing compared to their response to quite literally anything Trump did.
They even left the military dogs behind. #BidenMustGo
"If you think Trump deserved to be impeached for a phone call, but that Joe Biden did nothing wrong your commitment to stupidity is truly impressive!"
I can’t wait until they seek — and prob receive — a seat on the UN Human Rights Council.
Has a single person been fired for the gross incompetence we have witness over the past 2 weeks? Has anyone even been reprimanded? #BidenMustGo
Wondering where the hell all the fact checkers went. You’d think they’d be busy AF this last two weeks but it’s like they’re in hiding… more than even our pathetic president.
"Well, true to the Biden #AmericaLAST agenda, at least they got about 100,000 afghans out even if they are leaving lots of Americans behind STRANDED in a terrorist controlled country. Who cares if some are convicted rapists/suspected terrorists… they’ll love living in your towns!"
“President Trump brought American hostages home.  President Biden left Americans to become hostages.”   @Rothbard1776
Does anyone have a complete understanding of how many thousands of Americans Joe Biden abandoned and left stranded in a terrorist control country?   The Biden just administration created a hostage situation like we’ve never seen before as a country.
"Absolutely terrible! It should be no surprise for Joe is not capable of doing anything without a script. He is not fit for this job.  Family of Marine killed in Afghanistan slams Biden meeting as scripted, a ‘total disregard’ to Marine’s death   https://t.co/mwEshWcr4j"
Leaving American citizens for dead in a terrorist controlled country is not American… it’s treasonous.   “America is back” my ass.
So you’re saying they did not in fact “plan for every contingency?”   Asking for what’s probably thousands of Americans left behind and stranded In Afghanistan as well as tens of thousands of our allies who are in all likelyhood about to be hunted down by ISIS/Taliban squads.
"General Kenneth McKenzie calls Taliban-controlled Afghanistan “our generous host nation.""   It’s almost unfathomable what has happened to America so quickly under this administration!"
Pro Tip: The State Dept doesn't know either
Good luck to the Americans and our friends and allies who were apparently left behind and stranded in Afghanistan by the Biden administration.  https://t.co/V4OTkq5DY1
Well since it seems the Biden Administration couldn’t be bothered to get Americans out of Afghanistan at least they’re bringing back…   Wait for it… Convicted rapists!  I’m sure the vetting has been very thorough and none of this will be brought here. Democrat policies at work!
Its unconscionable that The United States of America is going to leave American citizens behind in Afghanistan.
Do these clowns know anything? I guess if they don't know someone is there they cant leave them abandoned so they rather not find out.
To fully understand the incompetence of this administration and the new woke military read and RT this!!!

It’s almost like it’s total bullshit.
The one person fired in the absolute debacle we are witnessing right now in Afghanistan is a lieutenant colonel who actually questioned the idiots who made these decisions simply asking for some accountability.  No one else and I doubt anyone else will be fired! Disgraceful
America is so oppressive that mothers in Afghanistan will hand their babies over to strangers with an an American Flag on their arms in hopes that their child may have a better life even if it’s not with them. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"For perspective… $85,000,000,000 worth of military being left to Taliban Terrorists means that each and every man, woman, and child in American contributed about $265 to their terrorist cause assuming +/-320 mil citizens.  Well done Democrats!  https://t.co/fXefvP5cNH"
I remember when “military leadership” wasn’t an oxymoron. It’s no wonder they can’t see the obvious coming anymore. The best bureaucrats and the absolute worst war-fighters are the ones that get promoted and make the decisions.
The same government that released the names of thousands of Americans trapped behind terrorist lines in Afghanistan to the Taliban will not release a list of names of two terrorist killed by a supposed drone strike… Let that sink in and what does it tell you?

The Biden Administration gave the Taliban a list of Americans still in country.   They gave a Terrorist organization that they have said on the record that they DO NOT TRUST a kill list. Let that sink in.

Joe Biden is a disgrace. Pass it on.
"This is 100% right, but it's not just Biden who needs to resign.  Blinken, Austin, Milley, Sullivan and Klain all own this disgrace too and need to go!!!!"
So now we are giving a terrorist organization the names of US citizens and other allies? How does this not endanger them greatly?   We impeach presidents for having a phone call with a president of another country but not this insanity! You awake yet?

No one can be this incompetent… Who is actually pulling the strings? Who has this kind of control over Biden? These are questions we have to start asking!
Biden surrendered Afghanistan and is leaving thousands of American citizens stranded there in the process...but no mean tweets guys 🙄🙄🙄
Thousands of American citizens are stranded behind enemy lines in Afghanistan with no way to get out and Joe Biden starts his speech to the nation by pitching his leftwing political agenda.  What an absolute disgrace!!!
Totally normal stuff guys. People better start paying attention because this doesn’t end well in my opinion.
I was told there are no Americans stranded in Afghanistan by the Press Sect just yesterday. Was she lying??? Why are there no fact checkers all over this?
"What a disgrace, the Taliban has made Joe Biden and the Democrats and unfortunately our country in the process the laughing stock of the world!"
Clinton lackey Terry McAuliffe supports discriminating against law-abiding American citizens.   He's a total disgrace.

Because Joe Biden is fine with terrorists being armed… just not law abiding Americans.
Unlike Obama’s “Red Line” they actually have resolve. The Taliban outsmarted Biden and “Team America Last” and have all the leverage. They know it and so does the world. They will use this to extract even more form the US and show just how incompetent the Biden admin is.
Anyone want to guess how long it will take to go from “America is Back” to “ISIS is back” under this President and our woke generals?
So Cuomo got a dog for political optics and photo ops but didn’t really want to deal it beyond that. Seems like a solid metaphor for the state of today’s Democrat Party.
