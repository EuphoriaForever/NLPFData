Taking your mask off at a table that is adjacent to two unoccupied tables is social distancing, because HOPEFULLY you're eating with people you're around regularly, and not just going out with all your friends. 

Nobody is stopping you from shopping. Nobody is stopping you from eating at a restaurant. You and the greeter wear a mask to protect each other, whether you believe in the efficacy or not. Once you sit down, you're only with the people that you're regularly exposed to, so you can take the mask off. 

All you have to do to keep restaurants open is wear a mask from the door to the table, and the people who refuse to do that are the reason restaurants are losing money, not because they have no business. 

People are still eating at restaurants with precaution, people are still getting togo, people are ordering door dash. 

I'm not saying that it's not causing a disruption. It is. 

But the number infected and the number of deaths is causing us to react, so it does make sense.

""If we assume there is a 1 in 10,000 chance per year of an accident occurring that results in a pandemic, and that the pandemic is typical for flu (infecting some 20% of the world's population), and has a case fatality rate of 0.05%, we get some 700 deaths per year in expectation.
Should we condone an experiment in which 700 people were expected to die per year?
Of course, some of these experiments might push the case fatality rate up by orders of magnitude. The utility of these experiments will need to be exceptional in order to justify thousands of deaths per year (in expectation).""

measles part 2:

measles vaccines also have an interesting case attached to it.

ask yourself what happens when a doctor and research says, that because of the current cases in a case series i would advise against taking the combined vaccines, until research is done to see whether there is an issue or isn't one.

well we don't have to wonder, because dr. andrew wakefield did say that and as a result the pharma industry  with the front attacker being brian deer.

short documentary about what happened:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo) 

so because one case series got published, that was free of any issues  the pharma industry and other interests did everything possible to destroy someone's life.

and remember, he didn't even say to not vaccinate. his original statements said, that the combined vaccine should be avoided until more research is done.

the goal by pharma to push combined vaccines as much as possible could not allow such statements to stand, so everything was done to throw dirt at the researcher, lie about the research and of course most importantly to prevent proper safety studies to EVER get done on the combined mmr vaccines.

this is how  strong the industry will attack anyone who even remotely questions one vaccine.

today you got criminal measles vaccine mandates, that are in fact measles, mumps and rubella vaccine mandates, because in most cases the single measles vaccine is no longer available. this of course is great profit for the industry.

i want you to understand the process here.

what should have happened is, that all mmr vaccinations would get stopped immediately and the best RCTs would get done with fully unvaccinated children to see whether or not the combined vaccine was safe.

instead of this a campaign was started against the doctor raising the concern and the clear goal to make an example out of him was also part of it.

today you might even hear some research say, ""yes i know, that they cause harm, but i can't research vaccines, because i don't want to get 'wakefielded'. ""

so overall NO, you can't claim, that the measles vaccines improved health overall for anyone.

there are NO proper safety studies done. there are tons of cases of death and disabilities and countless ones, that never get recorded to vaers.

measles itself is extremely harmless  and beneficial even and certainly nothing to fear and the vaccine causes measles outbreak as the study showed too and the vaccine shifts the ages around of when you get measles and it prevents the life long immunity to happen and the immunity, that would protect the baby in the most dangerous time, the first year of life.

so again NO, the measles vaccines do not improve overall health for us. there's no evidence for that and the evidence we do have shows the vaccines to kill, cause brain damage and to be MASSIVELY inferior to the natural beneficial infections, that give life long strong immunity.",-0.5195,1

I don't watch a whole lot of TV or news, when I do watch it tends to be BBC or Deutsche because I like to hear what's going on in the world at large sometimes. I've not had the chance to see many celebs using their fame to encourage folks to get vaccinated but I think that's a good thing. I respect people choosing not to get vaccinated out of fear of side effects but the covid ward horror stories I've read, from actual front line workers, tell me it's far less dangerous. Psudo-science and anti-inellectualism are causing so much needless harm, not just in the U.S. either. I'm no big brain, I dropped out of H.S., but I know enough to trust experts with more experience than I have birthdays.

I’ve stayed pretty consistent in how I disprove your sources from the beginning, so just saying I moved the goal posts doesn’t add up. 

I haven’t stated an opinion at all. All I’ve done is read your sources back to you. 

Mandatory vaccination are not happening the way you think they are happening, and you don’t know that because you are deep in an echo chamber. This entire conversation has shown that pretty clearly. If not to you then to people reading this thread. 

I am sad that you are digging your feet in, but again I was not really trying to convince you just whoever is on the fence and might read this thread. 

One more thing, if you arguing with an American who aligns with facts and science (like myself), insulting the fact that they are American doesn’t really do anything. The people who are insulted by that kind of thing are the people you find on subs like these. The anti-facts echo chambers. So if you want a reaction from insults you’re gonna need to change your strategy.

That’s adorable. One day, ask a friend to count how many times you touch your face, touch your mask, or uncover your nose/mouth within “a few hours.”

For proper hygiene, your mask should be replaced *every* time you touch it. 

And as for washing cloth masks in the laundry, you should be washing 2-4 a day, every day, depending on the duration of your use (assuming you do more than a single brief outing with a mask). 

There are absolutely people who wear masks with proper hygienic practices at least a majority of the time ... about 1 in a million, if I were to guess, but they exist. 

If you: 

- touch your mask without replacing it 
- remove and replace the same mask
- touch your mask and touch your eyes 
- do not promptly remove and replace a mask that has gotten wet (e.g., from sweating) 
- do not switch masks at least every 2-3 hours 
- *ever* reuse a mask that isn’t new or properly sanitized 

yeah, swell, you “wear a mask”... but you’re doing it completely wrong and it’s not healthy for anyone. 

Fun activity: go anywhere with a decent traffic and pick some people to watch for a few minutes. Then note how often they break one or more of those rules, with the result that they are incredibly unhygienic. 

No one follows proper hygienic mask practices in daily life, and any expectation that even a substantial minority of people *will* is a ridiculous fantasy.",-0.3169,26

*'The Georgia Guidestones are a granite monument erected in 1980 in Elbert County, Georgia, in the United States. A set of ten guidelines is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages'*

I doubt they are Google translated, so we need one or more language experts first.

*'and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient language scripts.'*

Also going to need at least one ancient language expert, even though most spend their careers on one language, let alone four.

*'One slab stands in the center, with four arranged around it. A capstone lies on top of the five slabs, which are astronomically aligned.'*

So, one person with basic equipment, excavated, leveled, and placed these perfectly straight, as well as aligning them with astrological features.  So, this one person is also a quarry worker, stone cutter, master heavy machine operator, and an astrologist.

*The monument is 19 feet 3 inches tall, made from six granite slabs weighing 237,746 pounds in all.*

Wow. How many trips would it take to move these?
According to this even the biggest standard flatbed can only hold 48,000lb.

http://flatbedtruckingcompanies.net/trailer-specifications%20.html

So now this one person also owns a flat bed trailer, a trucking license, and also has two machines capable of lifting these.

The enzyme also acts as a blood thinner so would be good for those micro clots that are talked about with the vaccines. Don't take it with food. Proteolytic enzymes that are taken on an empty stomach between meals won't be used on food but instead absorbed quickly and directly into your blood stream.

There was an obligation to get married, and remain married less you face significant difficulties if you leave/your husband abandons you- often homelessness and starving. Abuse was rampant. There's more equality now, but corporations are once again abusing the working class by profitting off of this step towards equality by forcing both parents to work through the implantation of lower wages.

&gt;I'm not really gonna reply to this but I don't understand why this sub gets so abhorrently vile about women. There was no secret conspiracy that women liked not voting because actually they have a whole secret illuminati where they run everything or whatever. They faced significant oppression then, they still do now (particularly poor to working class women) and it's disingenuous to just decide they didn't because you're mad, like, spousal support exists or something.

===

&gt;I'm not really gonna reply

You say in your reply...

It's funny how you think recognizing women in history as having been valuable and strong contributing members of society is supposedly vile. The reason why people respond vehemently to the idiotic delusions you espouse is for many reasons, but for me at least the offense against the truth stands out. People don't like liars and neo-libertine ideologues.

You're just an idiot who believes in propaganda over real history. For example.

&gt;There was no secret conspiracy that women liked not voting

Nobody voted throughout most of human history. You are the one who believes in a delusional conspiracy of men who all dominated society across all time in some sort of universal ""patriarchy"" while women were always oppressed. It was class (rather than sex) being the main divider among people, with men and women working together against the great adversities of life to survive. Because life was incredibly hard for the majority of people (actually, still true in most of the world) and it was co-operation that led to greatest success. The incredible privilege you enjoy today allows you to entertain such delusions.

Assuming people are receiving 2 doses each, that's a death rate of 0.004%.

Keep in mind, not all deaths are reported, and not all reported deaths are caused by the vaccine, so the number may vary.

Another point to consider is there is no reported correlation between these deaths and the age of those who died, so while the vaccine's overall death rate is lower than the virus', it may be a higher death rate for younger people who had a virtually 0% death rate before the vaccine.

When more than one co-morbidity is present, as in your case, it gets listed as ""AIDS-related pneumonia.""

""Vehicle accident"" might get a notation in the secondary box, but that's up to the attending physician.

My example was different. There's no way to prove that someone who tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 and any for any other respiratory infection died as a result of either one. The symptoms are identical. One can be asymptomatic for COVID and have a strep infection that becomes rheumatic fever. 

Someone in a car accident didn't die of COVID. Nor did the guy who ran his car off a cliff in the middle of a cardiac event. Nor did the cancer patient who was receiving palliative care in a hospice facility. I am fine with listing it when it actually contributes (the 85-year-old woman with high blood pressure and diabetes who's in long-term care and develops severe symptoms of COVID), but if there are no symptoms and all they have is a positive test result, that's not contributing.",0.5849,5

His 180 degree flip came without any significant change in the scientific data. Today there is zero legitimate studies that show community mask wearing is effective at preventing viral spread. 

Masks have terrible consequences to communities and otherwise healthy individuals.

Herd immunity is a concept where once most in a population are infected with a virus and develop immunity by not dying in turn protect those who don’t have immunity. One does not spew out antibodies the same way you spew out the coronavirus when you sneeze or cough. 

2. No matter how healthy an immune system it’s been seen time and time again with young healthy adults having their respiratory systems absolutely ravaged by the COVID 19 virus. Even those who are at 100 percent health are still at risk from dying or living with horrible long term effects that may leave them disabled. Look at Sweden they tried the herd immunity approach and their death toll and infection rates skyrocketed leading to the closure of the entire country. 

3. Your argument comparing obesity and someone’s diet to a virus that doesn’t discriminate is absolutely unfounded. A persons diet is a PRIVATE issue whereas public health is a PUBLIC issue. Once you become a danger to those around you by becoming a carrier of a deadly disease you are morally obligated to keep yourself isolated and safe until you are fine. With a pandemic on such large scales it’s necessary to have measures in place to combat it, even if they “infringe” on your rights to travel or get a haircut. 

4. Your argument of “it’s the dirty immigrants bringing in the measles” is absolutely ridiculous. I encourage you to look up all the measles outbreaks caused by regular families who simply chose not to vaccinate their children. 

5. “If keeping my freedoms to travel freely during a pandemic and not wear a mask because I’ve already gotten sick means children and others might suffer then that’s okay becuase I keep my freedoms” is just another stupid argument you’re trying to make.",-0.9638,1

* Mask wearing - I don't think this could be the cause, because if you look at states that have a mask mandate vs. state that don't, there is virtually no difference in the amount of covid cases. If it has absolutely no effect on covid, it can't possible have a measurable effect on Influenza.
* Social distancing - Let's split this up into two categories, the 6-feet rules and simply people staying at home instead of going outside. The 6-foot rule isn't going to have an effect, the direction that the wind is blowing can change the distance for transmissions down to 0 feet and up to 30 feet. Regarding people staying at home, it could have an effect, but I wouldn't say that every 100 instances where someone wants to leave their house 99 times they are now staying at home. So it's not enough to explain a 100x decrease.
* Trans-continental travel - This might be an explanation for Europeans, but it would cause ~~higher~~lower cases in the US. Up until recently the US has had consistently higher cases than everyone else in the world, so travel wouldn't cause the numbers to raise in the US. Early last year there was this ridiculous belief created by the media that travel somehow creates covid cases out of thin air, as if the act of moving from one place to another generates covid, I'm glad that phase is over.
* Increased hygiene - This is the most likely explanation. People are just a little bit more careful now, washing their hands when they get home and not touching dirty things. I supposed combined with the other things mentioned, it could cause a 100x decrease. This should affect covid proportionally though.

&gt;This propagandistic phrase is a vector designed to achieve five main goals: 

 - Give the false impression that a balance of evidence now proves that masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19;

 - Falsely assimilate commentary made in scientific venues with “evidence”;

 - Hide the fact that a decade’s worth of policy-grade evidence proves the opposite: that masks are ineffective with viral respiratory diseases;

 - Hide the fact that there is now direct observational proof that cloth masks do not prevent exhalation of clouds of suspended aerosol particles; above, below and through the masks;

 - Deter attention away from the considerable known harms and risks due to face masks, applied to entire populations The said harms and risks include that a cloth mask becomes a culture medium for a large variety of bacterial pathogens, and a collector of viral pathogens; given the hot and humid environment and the constant source, where home fabrics are hydrophilic whereas medical masks are hydrophobic. 

&gt;In short, I argue: op-eds are not “evidence”, irrelevance does not help, and more bias does not remove bias. **Their mantra of “a growing body of evidence” is a self-serving contrivance that impedes good science and threatens public safety.** I prove that there is no policy-grade evidence to support forced masking on the general population, and that all the latest-decade’s policy-grade evidence points to the opposite: NOT recommending forced masking of the general population. ***Therefore, the politicians and health authorities are acting without legitimacy and recklessly.***",-0.9503,3

[Johns Hopkins](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2020/urban-density-not-linked-to-higher-coronavirus-infection-rates-and-is-linked-to-lower-covid-19-death-rates.html) did a study on this and found that population density does not equal higher infection rates. 

&gt;it's a major destination of international and domestic travel.

So, is Florida. In fact,[ Florida had a 34% increase](https://www.visitflorida.org/resources/research/research-faq/) of visitors this year, while California had a [decrease of visitors by about -50%.](https://industry.visitcalifornia.com/research/travel-forecast) California did see more visitors overall than Florida, but I'd need to see a study on whether or not that accounts for their high number of cases/deaths relative to Florida's. 

&gt;That's how virus' spread. Your selfish ass goes to the movie and spreads it to the poor minimum wage employee who has to deal with your selfish ass who lives with his immuno-compromised mother and then gets her sick.

Is it any better if the poor minimum wage employees are out of a job and get kicked to the street because they can't afford rent? If someone is in that dire of a situation, they can double mask with a face shield and take extra precautions to lessen their risks, but let's not pretend this situation is anywhere near the norm. Only 3% of the population is immunosuppressed. 

&gt;Texas and other states that remove their mask mandates are going to surge in cases

I know this source is kind of shitty (you can look up the charts individually yourself), but [mask mandates don't seem to have a steady effect on cases/deaths](https://rationalground.com/mask-charts/). Cases are dropping significantly in the country as a whole, there's a vaccine, we know a shitload more about the virus than we did last year, and we have better treatments for it. It's over.

You can keep resorting to name calling and screaming at people trying to have a rational conversation with you about masks and lockdowns, but that's not going to change facts or convince people to go back to cowering in their houses in fear.",-0.9918,1

I know I'm regularly paranoid of the people staring at me when I walk into a restaurant without a mask. My father had even pointed out the whispering of some people too, which contributes as well.

Mass punishments are one of the big reasons why I left the military after one enlistment. I got tired of getting hosed because of that one asshole who always decides to get in a bar fight out in town and gets the entire unit out on restriction.

“It takes a dictatorship to protect a democracy.”

It is the pro narrative cult that are in full mass hysteria and have not an ounce of logic, reason, or common sense. Hospitalization rates? Hospitals are always running at near capacity, otherwise they would go bankrupt. That is why over one million hospital workers were furloughed when hospitals stopped doing ""elective"" surgeries and screenings, thinking they were going to get a mass influx of covid patients (it never materialized). Only hospitals in a few hotspots were actually overwhelmed, namely NYC, but keep in mind the NYC hospital system infrastructure problems and how it gets overwhelmed every bad flu season. NYC had an especially high number of people infected that no other place besides northern Italy (also a place regularly overwhelmed during flu seasons) had. That is why serological studies are now showing that over 60% of the population there contracted the virus. NYC is unique circumstances and not the norm. A bad flu season would have had the same outcome. Also, it is well documented at this point that thousands of deaths attributed to covid are either cases of where a patient died of another cause but was counted as covid death simply because they tested positive. There is also cases of where people died because of malpractice of putting people on ventilators when they just needed oxygen therapy, or critically ill patients who contracted covid in hospital settings. Then there are the governors that put covid patients back in nursing homes, so more nursing home patients died than would have. But even regardless of all that, the excess mortality rate is not significantly higher than any other year. At the end of the year, the harvesting effect will become apparent, as people who would have died several months later of their comorbidities, simply died earlier. Then there are countries like Sweden, who did not do draconian lockdowns, but this year they only a had a few hundred more deaths in the first five months of the year than they did in 2015.",-0.9961,1

&gt;[For the twenty countries currently most affected by COVID-19 worldwide, the bars in the chart below show the number of deaths either per 100 confirmed cases (observed case-fatality ratio) or per 100,000 population (this represents a country’s general population, with both confirmed cases and healthy people).](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)

The columns and axes are then labeled *deaths per 100,000 population*, and *DEATHS/100K POP.*

And then, if you scroll down the table and look at what number is in the table in the *DEATHS/100K POP* column for the row labeled *United States*, you will see the number *171.94*.

Per 100,000 population is a standard metric for normalizing mortality rates by the size of the population the mortality events are happening in, so that you can compare rates among populations of different sizes. The fact that you are not aware of population normalization tells me that you have likely never read a study on public health of any kind, as this is 100% standard.

To calculate this number you do (562,000 * 100,000/328,000,000), and you get the 171 deaths per 100,000 they have in that table. Where 562,000 is the number of covid deaths in the US, 328,000,000 is the US population, and 100,000 is the factor you are normalizing population by.

Please consider at least trying to read the sources you link. To the extent that you can not follow, voicing no opinion is generally the wisest tact.",0.942,-2

So a PCR test is a very specific test. It's pretty old. Basically, you design these things called primers, which very specifically bind to certain regions of genetic material. Not to get too technical, but covid is an RNA virus and the primers used bind to DNA, so they convert covid RNA to DNA (this is the RT step in RT PCR) and then have primers designed to specifically bind this DNA. An important concept to keep in mind is that these primers SPECIFICALLY target certain regions. In this case, they target a sequence that is only found in covid. If I take any of my cells and try this, I will not get a result.

So what we have at this step is a random sample of DNA (let's pretend the person has covid) and our primers that specifically bind covid DNA, which we made via RT. This sample has a lot of other DNA too. Now the amount of general genetic material found in this sample is small. PCR is a technique in which you add your primers (and a couple of other things irrelevant to my point) to your sample with the goal of amplifying the targeted sequence so that you can determine it's presence. Not to get too technical again, but this is where the CT values come into play.

Three things happen in one cycle:

1. The DNA splits via heat. If you want to visualize this, imagine the generic image of DNA with two strands. Now split it down the middle

2. Primers bind to the specific target sequence.
Let's pause here. This is my main point. These primers will only bind the sequence you've designed them to. You can design them to target anything. In fact, it's a very regularly used assay in the lab. We design primers all the time to target different genes in our systems. For example, in my research, I once deleted a gene called ESR1 in breast cancer. How do I confirm it's been deleted? I design some primers that target the region that I deleted. This means that if my deletion worked, I do not expect my primers to bind anything and I do not expect a result at the end of my PCR (which is a good thing in this case).

3. Primers get extended to create a copy of each strand


So if you start with one double stranded DNA, by the end of one cycle, you expect two - double stranded DNA. I'll walk you through it


Step 1: separate -&gt; You go from one double stranded DNA to two single stranded DNA

Step 2: Anneal primers -&gt; self explanatory

Step 3: Extend -&gt; when this finishes, you now have two double stranded DNA

Now if you increase the number of cycles, you are increasing the amount of DNA of your primer target by 2^n, where n is the number of cycles. One cycle gives 2^1, which is 2.

The whole point of this is that I've increased the amount of DNA to a point I can easily and cheaply visualize it (something like a gel). So with all this in mind, if I decide to run my sample through a gel, I would expect to see the presence of this PCR product because if the patient did not have covid, the primers would not anneal and all these cycles would make no difference.

All this to say, that sure, you can totally debate what the correct number of cycles is, but that's more of a technical thing for the lab rats trying to optimize the assay because if there is no covid RNA present, you will not get the DNA after RT, and when you PCR it, you will not get a result.

This is also why it's possible to have false negatives, where someone does have it, does not test positive. There are hundreds of reasons that covid does not get on the swab. But the specificity of the test is also why there are so few false positives.

W.r.t. the culturing argument, it's a little vague. Cell culturing is a very different topic. We've managed to culture covid, but its a very involved process. I personally have not looked into it because it's not relevant to my work, but I do culture other mammalian cells. It's very technical. You have to find out what cells you can safely culture the virus in, what media, etc, all while trying to not fuck it up enough so that when you do your studies on it, it behaves as similarly as possible to itself in the wild (ie in humans).

If you look at the numbers whatever is going on with police killings, race doesn’t place a major issue and it barely accounts for black homicides.

The computer models used to justify lock downs were based on data that had no grounding in reality once people were able to see even some of the data sets used to create them and in the case of Germany the goverment had paid for a model they could use to justify lockdown. We know this becouse the contract was leaked/discovered and reported on by a German paper

I am sure most parents can help a young child with spelling and arithmetic but what about teens studying algebra, geometry, natural sciences, history, literature etc.? The average person has forgotten most of what they learnt, let alone be able to teach that to someone. 

Learning and teaching are rather different. Being able to sit and teach oneself does not make someone able to teach others, the main difference being the ability to communicate a concept without confusing the person by pitching too high, or boring by pitching too low. Many academics are rather bad lecturers as they cannot communicate what they are brilliant at.  

A teacher is able to teach 30 kids, some of high ability, some low, some with learning difficulties because they do it every day, are often a specialist in their subject holding at least a bachelors degree in it and constantly undergo professional development and work with a team of other teachers, teaching assistants, special educational needs specialists etc. 

To claim that the average parent’s ability to teach is equal to that is daft. 
I’m sure most people can multiply 2 digit numbers on paper, explaining how to do that to a child who has never seen it done is rather more difficult, especially explain it in a way that leads naturally from what they currently know and make it easy to replicate then apply to unseen problems. That process becomes exponentially harder when you’re not 100% sure how that thing works yourself e.g. most people would struggle to work out x and y from 
2x + 4y = 16, 3x + 5y = 21 which is something learned at age 14… try explaining the process of solving it to a 14 year old when you’re struggling to do so yourself.  

That’s where most kids have really struggled in the pandemic, those close to GCSE and A Level exams (or the country equivalent) where parents really cannot help as they lack the knowledge.",-0.8702,1

In the medical field, those who would have issues masking for long periods tend to factor that into their choice of specialization.

Our population structures are no the same as in 1968, we had a much younger, much more spread out population, much smaller population. Not to mention, the deaths aren’t calculated the same way. There was no running death total based off of PCR tests for the 1957 and 1968 flus. The IFR remained the same at 0.3%. It was a disease that disproportionately affected the elderly as well. And you are wrong, if we had done anything then remotely close to what we have done now we would have stunted our economy and society. We have an ageing population, and there is no surprise that after a baby boom, more people start dying around 70 years later.

Good morning Mr Poloncarz,
I am writing you on behalf of your recent comments on Bills/Sabres and vaccinations.

A little backstory: before Covid I traveled to Buffalo every December for 8 years straight. You may be aware there is a local metal band that does a big concert every December in Buffalo. I and my large group of friends went every year for 8 years straight. Often attending Bills and Sabres games if they were playing home during our sometime week-long stay. In the past 8 years, as a group, I have estimated we probably spent close to $10,000 (if not more) total in your city. Between transportation, concert tickets, Bills &amp; Sabres tickets, Bills &amp; Sabres merchandise, hotel rooms, local restaurants, local bars, local stores, etc. I have always touted Buffalo as one of my favorite places I've ever visited (I've been to almost every US state) because the people are so friendly and outgoing. 

After your announcement I will not be spending one more dime in, or for, your city. I will no longer represent or support the Bills or Sabres and will not give them one penny. 

Enough is enough. I am vaccinated (*), yet I still have a problem with your statement and decision. You are creating a Caste system of the haves and the have-nots with your decision. One in which people who feel they shouldn't get the vaccine- whether it be medical, religious, or personal- aren't going to be allowed to participate in regular society.

Even if this decision gets overturned, I won't be returning, nor any of my friends. I have a sneaking suspicion many others feel the same way, whether they voice it to you or not. I will not stand-by and financially support people who are trying to divide society. It is no business of the Bills or the Sabres what peoples' medical histories are.

(*A little fib on my part)",0.9637,1

Yes, sure there’s a chance that he gets COVID and his immune system is strong and he doesn’t get very sick from it. But on average, COVID symptoms start showing up around five days after infection; the issue is that an infected person can spread it for essentially a whole work week without even knowing they have it. Sure, masks may not be 100% effective at blocking every single virus particle emitted from a person, but they do significantly reduce the amount of particles that make it through. This man could very well have COVID, go to the store, speak/breathe/cough/etc., and infect someone (or several people) that do not have immune systems as strong as his. His choice to not wear a mask in a busy, enclosed public space is a selfish decision and he should not be proud.

I know I’ll probably get downvoted for this, but I don’t care. I’m not trying to sell you masks, vaccines or anything like that. I’m a human who cares about other humans. Wearing a mask is a very simple way of reducing the chance that you spread the virus to others.",0.8294,-1

There's been a lot of discussion about that amongst us ""traditional"" Catholics.  A lot of us think we have an idea of what's coming and it's not pretty. To talk about it sounds like conspiracy theories, but, well. Thankfully there's also the faith to get you through.  I'd probably be a basket case without it. Lol. 

Anyway, I thought I'd share some more links, just because I know what it's like to wake up one day and feel like there's no one to talk to about this stuff, and wondering where to get news.  (Mainstream media is worse than useless these days, imo.  It's basically a psy-op.)  There's a lot of Catholic resources because the traditional faction knows what's going on.  When I realized something was wrong and went looking for the truth, it brought me back to my faith. Anyway,  even if you're not Catholic, plenty of non-Catholics do watch these, so I think you might be ok. 

I hope your wife will be ok. It's a good thing she has you. I'll add her to my prayers tonight.

For months, nearly everyone involved thought the medical center had had a huge whooping cough outbreak, with extensive ramifications. Nearly 1,000 health care workers at the hospital in Lebanon, N.H., were given a preliminary test and furloughed from work until their results were in; 142 people, including Dr. Herndon, were told they appeared to have the disease; and thousands were given antibiotics and a vaccine for protection. Hospital beds were taken out of commission, including some in intensive care.
 
Then, about eight months later, health care workers were dumbfounded to receive an e-mail message from the hospital administration informing them that the whole thing was a false alarm.
 
Not a single case of whooping cough was confirmed with the definitive test, growing the bacterium, Bordetella pertussis, in the laboratory. Instead, it appears the health care workers probably were afflicted with ordinary respiratory diseases like the common cold.
 
Now, as they look back on the episode, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists say the problem was that they placed too much faith in a quick and highly sensitive molecular test that led them astray.
 
Infectious disease experts say such tests are coming into increasing use and may be the only way to get a quick answer in diagnosing diseases like whooping cough, Legionnaire’s, bird flu, tuberculosis and SARS, and deciding whether an epidemic is under way.
 
There are no national data on pseudo-epidemics caused by an overreliance on such molecular tests, said Dr. Trish M. Perl, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins and past president of the Society of Health Care Epidemiologists of America. But, she said, pseudo-epidemics happen all the time. The Dartmouth case may have been one the largest, but it was by no means an exception, she said.
 
There was a similar whooping cough scare at Children’s Hospital in Boston last fall that involved 36 adults and 2 children. Definitive tests, though, did not find pertussis.
 
“It’s a problem; we know it’s a problem,” Dr. Perl said. “My guess is that what happened at Dartmouth is going to become more common.”",-0.7096,2

A better world is one in which China and the pharmaceutical industry cannot capture a global organization and task them with carrying their water.

Weird way to choose to word that, unless you being intentionally deceptive. So in these countries, where the life expectancy is only 5%, are men living longer compared to other countries or are women living shorter? You need said, just suggested that the difference could be, with no evidence, down to face cover wearing.

No, the taxes I've paid/pay cover my medical costs. Don't worry though, you don't have to pay me back for your birth that I funded.

Fire service don't put out fires in unoccupied buildings? Regardless, they are a public service that is paid for by tax. Just because I've never needed to be rescued from a fire doesn't mean I'm opposed to paying for the emergency service that could save my life in the future.

We could back back to the days of private fire insurance though, right? To defeat the fire-fighter monopoly the government has. Pay taxes to government to provide a service that, and for the training of the people that work in that service, and their wages, while they tell us what we can and can't do with fire in our own houses!

Government still supports the sale of fireworks, could buy those in stores in demember, hardly essential, but of course the government want people to buy fireworks, because they cause fires, and that means they can promote their fire service.

I want a free market on fire services . . . the option to choose if I want to pay for fire protection, and to use alternative fire-fighting method, like crystal based fire fighting. Not this fire-fighting monopoly the government has.

The government aren't opposed to the tobacco industry, people are, and that's why people don't want to smoke . . . because of the government restrictions of tobacco products aren't right and shouldn't be used, but they are used because they people made them law, despite people wanting to smoke . . . yeh, makes sense.

Wow, you can buy nutritional supplements despite the monopoly that won't let you buy them? There is research into crystals and homeopathy, it doesn't work.

Oh, now you can't buy supplements, that was a quick turn around. Imagine the government requiring products to be honest about what exactly they can, and do, do.

That explains the water thing pretty well. That's the EU though, so when you say ""THE GOVERNMENT"" you mean A government, that no longer governs the UK, where you are totally currently living.

I don't think you are allowed to have knee-jerk reactions to stupid statements though; remember ""eating kills you"".

Wow, combining substances? Sounds like the devils game, ""chemistry"", to me. I don't trust anything man-made and non-natural. I at least want to be able to test a product that might combine hundreds of ""combined substances"" give me the product and a list of what is claimed to be in it and I'll go down to my private lab and test for each claimed chemical . . . obviously I have created all the testing kits too, because I don't trust what chemicals others might have put in my testing kits.

Also, you just dismissed a bunch of different alternative medicines there by implying they HAVE to be able combining substances . . . which they don't all do.

Thats probably my one gripe about some anti-maskers, the ones making scenes in retail stores or the DMV, they aren't helping anything. Also it seems like its usually people who don't have or think they don't have anything to lose. No family who is at risk who they might spread the Vid too, no consequences. That I don't like. 

Well, the point is, masks do not work and they are not going to protect you from contracting a virus. So knowing this, what is the point of appeasing someone purely for psychological reasons. Of course you have to consider that although you may only be in their for 10 minutes, what about the employees forced to wear these masks for their entire shift? And what about these kids that are being forced to wear them all day at school? Of course they want to wear them everywhere so unless you are only going to Walmart for 10 minutes then going straight home, you're wearing it for a far greater time period on a daily basis. 

Just think, you wear a mask, then you go and visit grandma, well COVID is not just on your mask but on your clothes. So on your stop to say hi to grandma and you deposit numerous COVID particles in their home. 

If there was any logic or reason, i mean any at all, then perhaps i could see an argument, but there isn't and by being complicit, it gives them more and more power to infringe upon people's basic human rights further and further. 

You see, i worked in asbestos removal many years ago, and we were required to not only wear a respirator, (and  asbestos particles are much larger than COVID), but we also had to wear a Tyvex suit, and upon leaving the area, we had to remove our suits, in the shower, keeping our mask on, then remove the respirator's cartridge's and then remove the mask itself and wash it thoroughly. We were also required to change the cartridge's regularly becasue even these filtration devices had thresholds which if surpassed would allow asbestos fibers to bypass either through the cartridge itself or through imperfections in the seal to our face, becasue the clogging would  create more negative pressure around he edges as we inhale. 

So unless you are following this procedure to prevent the spread of COVID, well then you're just kidding yourself and so is everyone who thinks these cloth masks have any impact whatsoever. 

I'm not trying to be rude or arrogant, but facts are facts, and I've dealt with many people who suffer from forms of psychosis and the worst thing you can do is entertain them as it only perpetuates the problem therefore wearing a mask to only provide someone with a ""sense"" of security is not the right thing to do.",-0.9898,2

And yes, MATH IS A LANGUAGE.

Okay…
Let’s say objectively I am wearing a black t-shirt. Someone could say, “he is wearing a shirt” or “he is wearing a t-shirt” and that would be correct. That’s how language works, yes.  
But if someone says, “he is wearing a white t-shirt” then that would be incorrect. Sitting there arguing semantics and how language is used would not change the fact that I am wearing a black shirt. If you want to insist that I was wearing a white shirt to everyone that could plainly see I’m wearing a black shirt while arguing about words being a language, they would think you have some kind of intellectual deficiency.

Do you understand?

Edited for grammar and readability and also: 

There is no way to prove that the black I perceive is the same as the black as you perceive but we can all agree that the shirt is black.

„Why SR is so much better than NoFap

NoFap is NOT same as Semen Retention.
When you practice NoFap, what you are actually doing is cultivating powerful creative sexual energy by not ejaculating. But, you choose to do absolutely nothing with that energy. It becomes stagnent. This is reason why wet dreams, blue balls and flatlines happen to people who do NoFap.
I don't say NoFap is bad, sure it is great start, it will help you big time fight porn addiction. It will give you insight into SR.
Problem is, after some time, you will collect so much energy (espcially if you are teen or in 20s!) and you will become sexually frustrated. What you are doing is holding up your semen, and it's like a time bomb, you will have to release sooner or later. This is why concept of relapse is so much more common in NoFap.
Also, NoFap has bad concept of sex. You will release when having sex and you are most likely to go back to your bad patterns. Ejaculation will drain you and deplete you.
So why SR is better?
When you practice SR, you cultivate sexual energy, but you also transmute it. Most importantly you have some sort of spiritual practice that makes it possible to move that energy throughout the body.
Qigong, Meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi.
Those are the best way to transmute your sexual energy.
When having spiritual practice, you won't need to. count your days, and you won't relapse or ever have thoughts to watch porn.
You also have goals in your life. You work out with your physical body and you keep learning and studying. Those are also one of ways to use your sexual energy so it doesn't get stuck.
In SR path, you should learn how to have orgasm without ejaculation. This way you will feel nourished and energized after sex instead of feeling drained, depleted and sleepy. Also you can last in bed more than any female, because you won't get drained from ejaculations.“",0.9756,-2

If it is the study they’re talking about, then I think it has several obvious differences from our current situation, and I don’t see how it could qualify as an honest comparison to kids wearing masks. 

[This](http://rickackerly.com/2012/03/14/still-face-experiments-are-more-about-power-than-attachment-parenting/) article explores what the still-face experiment could mean for kids. The author posits that agency may be more important than attachment here. They even use school as a main example for what that could mean for the kid. The author suggests that making kids sit quietly while doing what they’re told for 12 years could have a similar effect on kids’ mental health as the still-face experiment situation. So if this is the study they’re referring to, and they’re comparing still-face treatment to abuse, then we could extrapolate that and say school in general is abuse. Using your phone around your kid is abuse because you’re not paying attention. 

You could run wild from that point, and start labeling everything as child abuse, and that’s just one reason why I take issue with OP calling masks for kids child abuse. 

Furthermore, covering your mouth and nose isn’t going to  stop someone from communicating, even non-verbally. You still have eyes, hands, and body language, and those things can convey as much or more than words. 

If that’s indeed the study he was referring to, I’d love to debate the merits more if someone has a good counterpoint. If that’s not the study, I’d love for OP to chime in and drop a link to whatever they were referring to. And thanks again for the link - didn’t know about this study, but it is fascinating irrespective of the current context.",0.7769,1

But it's this ideology that's making us a laughing stock in front of the world.

I'm a gentle person. I wouldn't actually get violent, they're just pushing me to the point where I'm just getting that upset, and I am not an easy person to anger.

Unfortunately, I have uncontrolled seizures so I cannot drive. That leaves my options for work extremely limited. On top of that, they do pay me better than I've ever been paid before. I have few qualifications, I didn't go to college and stocks are what I'm best at. Got a good ACT score and that's pretty much my only brag, resume-wise lol.

Another problem there is since I'm still so young, most of my jobs have lasted for 6 months to a year, excluding this one and my ""job"" as an equity trader. My resume is really starting to suck, and the job market out here is terrible. Many businesses are small and have indefinitely closed down.

You're right. I really, REALLY want to stand up for myself. I just don't know what to say. My bosses are up my arse 24/7 and I'm just so damn exhausted. These people are the absolute worst, and I'm really good at my job. I feel like they can't afford to lose me, and they just know they can walk all over me, and so they do.

Thank you VERY much for your advice, but I have one more thing to ask - can you think of any way I can stand up for myself either to CC or my low-level crazy managers? Seriously, 99% positive they can't afford to lose me. I really need to keep this job, I'm dirt poor right now unfortunately. I don't want to rant and rave but I really want to stand up for myself and explain THIS IS NOT OKAY.

Work used to be fine. Now it's hell on earth. Literally tried to end it all via overdose a few weeks ago because of this, and my last family member drinking herself to death. I'm far beyond the end of my rope. Hope seems to be dead at this point :(

No, it prevents airflow. The % of oxygen stay the same, but the effort to breath in is way superior. A bit like breathing while your body is in water, but worse. Try to put a face mask in front of your air-vents from your computer, you ll see what i mean.

The natural protein making process within our body, via mrna, isn’t supposed to make viruses, so even though the process is sound, it’s tricking our body into doing something it normally wouldn’t. That’s the simplest way to put it. 

And then there’s compounding effects. We know there are variants of covid, so will we need a new vaccine for each variant? Or “booster shots” what do you estimate the total amount of shots we would need for covid and it’s variants? 6-12? We already knows it’s between 2-3 shots just for base covid. When over time we keep stacking these new mrna instructions inside our body, who exactly knows what outcome this will have? Our bodies after all aren’t designed to be virus-Protein-making factories. Our bodies are however designed to fight off infection normally through the immune system, which is what a normal vaccine does. We breath in foreign matter everyday and, if you’re healthy enough your immune system fights it off no problem. 

Let’s theorize that for the next 50 years mrna shots are the only “vaccine” available to us. 

That’s 50 years of a foreign substance entering our body, to tell our body to create cells that appear as a virus. Is it really your naive opinion that this will have no effects on us? 

If it’s up to choice I would rather risk being in the 1% who die from covid, than being in the 1-100% who are mrna labrats with side effects unknown. 

Used to be a time where you’d go to a local business and be paid 2-5 thousand dollars to take experimental shots like this. Now we are basically being told by everyone that if we don’t take it we are baby killers, we can’t travel, go to work, enter certain establishments. 

Medicine made by a COMPANY should not lead to preferential treatment in a free society. 

It’s no different than if I wasn’t allowed to go to work because I didn’t drink Coca Cola. Which may sound crazy and like a dumb example, but that’s exactly what these vaccine passports are. This is all magnified by the fact that even IF you choose to take the shot, you have no choice as to which companies shot you do receive. And as anyone with even a child’s understanding of business knows, not every company outputs the same quality of product. 

And I’m not just talking about their “efficiency rates” I’m talking about everything else involved, their quality control, control groups, risks/side effects involved, the research done into long term compounding issues that may arise from the mrna shot being used multiple times, or mixed with other things, anything. The myriad of prescription meds people are on, the food and drink they consume, their own unique physiology, any number of this things can be something to factor in, and given this is the most rushed vaccine in human history, I’m not going to believe this due diligence was done especially not by all these different companies. It’s not just naive but an ignorantly foolish assumption. 

Thanks for writing out what you did, I appreciate it as it sounds well put, I just choose to air on the side of caution since I’m not in the risk category of dying from covid.",0.7042,1

How much time did hospital admins have to get the resources they needed before winter 2020?  Why weren't field hospitals reconstructed during fall 2020 if hospitals were so close to being overwhelmed?  I believe that hospitals telling the public ""you aren't doing enough, we haven't changed our infrastructure in any meaningful way and still haven't figured out how to get more resources"" is passing the buck.

So, why do I believe that hospitals around the country are not currently overwhelmed?  Because, firstly, every single data tracker you provide shows that most hospitals in the country are not overwhelmed with covid patients, which, by your own admission, must mean that said hospitals aren't overwhelmed in general.

The hospitals that have high percentages of inpatients with covid (I don't actually know if all of these inpatients are being treated for covid, or if they just have a positive covid test upon admission, which is of course a problem) do not thereby have high percentages of hospital beds taken.

Basically what I'm saying is the following: this claim that hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed is not true (I understand you've refined your claims and aren't making this claim now, I'm just getting my point laid out).  Hospitals that have high percentages of inpatients with covid are both in population dense places and in population sparse places.  But, even given these things, we don't have the following information: is it unusual to have high percentages of inpatient beds taken by those with a respiratory virus in winter?  Is it unusual for hospitals to have high percentages of bed use in winter?  Were hospitals in the past considered to be overwhelmed when they had high percentages of bed use?  And, are hospitals currently inundated with both patients with covid and patients using beds for other reasons?  From the sources you've provided, I can only see that some hospitals (a minority of them, and not all in population dense areas) have, apparently, relatively high percentages of beds taken by people who have tested positive for covid.  Again, given that we don't know why these people are being treated in the hospital, we can't say that this is unusual or will burden the healthcare system in those areas.

You may say, ""Don't you remember the 5% experts NPR curated???  THEY say that this percentage of covid-positive patients taking beds is a problem, so of course it will negatively impact the healthcare systems in those areas.""  It seems to me, from what I've read that you've provided, the only way that an increase in percentages like that would negatively impact the healthcare systems in those areas, is that all of the covid-positive patients are being treated for covid.  The reason I say this is that, that would mean that, in addition to the other patients in the hospital, there would then be an influx of a brand new kind of patient.

But, I have two problems with this 5% claim: (1) I'm sure there are other experts who disagree with the, I'm sure completely unbiased, experts that NPR chose, (2) barring (1), all the experts could still be wrong (not uncommon with predictions), and (3) most of the usual flu patients that would be hospitalized, aren't being hospitalized.

If (3) is the case, and we know it is, then either that means those patients who would be there, are not, meaning that there is a net-negative difference in inpatients in every hospital this winter, meaning that the 5% difference probably doesn't matter; OR, it is the case that there is no significant difference between the number of inpatients this winter and the number of inpatients last winter, in which case that 5% difference doesn't matter; OR, there are so many more covid-positive inpatients that there is a net-positive difference, and this would obviously show up in the places where masks aren't being used and lockdowns weren't enforced or weren't enforced for long (I'm just granting this assumption for argument).  We're not seeing the third disjunct, so probably not true, and the other two disjuncts just aren't good for this idea that we're in some kind of danger regarding hospital capacity.

So, healthcare workers can do tik tok dances, but better not simultaneously claim that hospitals are overwhelmed.

And here's my question for you: doesn't it just seem obvious that, if the hospital were overwhelmed, those nurses doing a dance in the hallway would be interrupted by people running by, people telling them to stop, stretchers being wheeled down the hallway, etc.?",-0.9751,1

The schools in these areas are very rough and dogshit with students leaving classes whenever they want, arguing and sometimes fighting teachers and even climbing out windows or into them. 

Certainly, the school's systems according to the statistics aren't getting more effective but they are trying their best with a system that doesn't care about them. The first year I entered high school, they put in an exam that affected your graduation 5 years later and whether or not you'd be a shit kicker or a money maker. This immense pressure wasn't a choice by the school, it was by the system. 

Obviously, for years we've all discussed the idiocy of the school system being dogshit. Yes, I will now agree with you because I put thought into it that the school system is very bad. Hell, even I had 2 suicide attempts last year when I thought that my final year of school was wasted and I could've done better. 

The real issue isn't about kids committing suicide. Its that the school will put immense pressure on children that are there to learn and if the kid can't handle it, the school could give less of a shit if the kid died. A couple of candles, one prayer assembly and then moving onto school. When my dad died, the fucking school counsellor made me play with a sandpit and asked me 'what's really going on?' Are you fucking kidding me? A significant being in my life died.

1) Parents are finally waking up to what mercenary, uncaring, entitled socialist fucks most teachers and their unions are.

2) More and more parents will home-school. Perhaps the lessening of exposure to the collectivist ""education"" machine will have positive effects.

3) More children will have a parent at home full-time, *to you know, actually be a parent.*

4) Seeds of suspicion have been sown by things like teachers not wanting parents to be present during remote learning. Many are asking ""What is it you don't want us to see?"", and ""I'm the parent, who do you teachers think you are?""

I realize that it might not be this way for doomers, but from what I know, the majority of parents doing home-schooling are fairly based; it has less to do with ""Rona, and more to do with quality of instruction.",0.2498,13

Ok so why is some doctor that has got their vaccine worried about going to the store and contracting covid if the vaccine is all 99% effective and also 90% effective at decreasing the chance of hospitalizations.  Also we haven't been able to even study the delta variant that long anyway so how do they fkn know?  
And I'm like... It feels like a dream that they once said that covid can't be like blocked by these masks and also they weren't deemed helpful for their ability to actually help keep out airborne particles but to not lick up or let lose your own droplets.  
Why does nothing make any sense? 
I feel like the only consistent thing happening on their end is that they are the only ones allowed to say anything and have it be true.  Even if you point out a fallacy in what they are saying with evidence.",0.9756,11

you're allowed here because you're not a danger. you oppose the superficial, strike at the hydra's heads, yet never look lower to its heart. if anything, you help the powers that be: you're the ""insane conspiracy theorist"" they can easily point to, like a zoo animal in a cage, to convince the fence-sitters their wicked side is better.

i say this not to insult you at all. in fact i wanna do the opposite, you're on the right path. but you need to keep walking down it, not get stuck at a spot that seems right and only end up as controlled opposition.

""I am so sorry for the loss of your beloved mother. I had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine recently and I absolutely detest anti-vaxxers and their willful head-in-the-sand ignorance. Even if I had suffered a horrible reaction and knew worse was yet to come (I had a sore arm and a headache for a little while) I would still be jumping to get the second dose of my vaccine. Vaccinations are so, so important. Especially in the face of something as vastly dangerous and terrible as covid.

Your mother sounds like she was a wonderful woman. She clearly raised a level-headed and intelligent daughter who obviously loved her very much, so she must have done a few things right. :) My heart hurts for your grief, and at the same time I am glad you can honor her memory by not lashing out in pain at the potential cause of her untimely death. It is absolutely a tragedy, and yet you are right: the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk of (very rare) adverse effects, even when they happen at great personal cost. Because covid is objectively worse in terms of overall damage, and we cannot afford to let it run through us unchecked. Science is not perfect, but it is the best defense we have... And sometimes terrible things just happen to good people regardless of our very best intentions.

I wish you peace and healing, however you may find it. Thank you for sharing your mom's story. I hope people will take your message to heart.""

I'm dumbfounded by this comment. How sheepish can you be? Covid is not that dangerous, at least not as much as the media likes to claim. Why risk a horrible reaction or death with an inability to sue the manufacturers for something that literally has a 99.7% survival rate? The person's mother would almost certainly be better off taking her chances against Covid.",0.9846,66

My man, you don't get what I'm saying.  Those people died not because hospitals were actually overrun, but because those people were led to believe they were and thus didn't go when they should have.  And they *could* have, because hospitals were not actually overrun.  If they were, both the Javits field hospital and the USS Comfort would've been full.  Even at the peak, it was a myth that hospitals in NYC were overflowing.  That only happened at Elmhurst (where the epicenter in the city was), and it was because of shitty allocation of resources and a failure to ensure that patients were transported elsewhere.

&gt;But at the same time, at it's peak, COVID was killing about a thousand people a day in NY. That's COVID specifically, not heart attacks/strokes/etc.

Again, this is anecdotal, but medical professionals I know have disputed that all of those people died of covid.  Many of them *were* heart attacks/strokes/etc.

&gt;This is a common misunderstanding. People keep thinking about individual safety in a pandemic (""I'm young/healthy, I should be able to do whatever I want"") instead of collective safety (""I should be safe so that I don't spread this to other people, even if it won't kill me -- it could kill somebody else"").

But that's not what you seemed to be implying before.  You were acting like the entire population was dropping dead.

&gt;Those people in nursing homes died because somebody with COVID visited them, not because they did something dangerous to get it.

So then it's simple.  Keep nursing home patients isolated by keeping out visitors.  As opposed to shutting down society.
Bur even so, they didn't die from visitors, they died from Cuomo putting covid patients in there.  We talked about this, remember?

&gt;Pandemics thrive on young people doing whatever they want because they think there's no consequences.

Consider an even distribution. 18 ages. 312/18 = 17 and 1/3.

He was getting Misdisgnosed left and right over zoom and phone calls. I worked in direct contact with the public throughout the entire pandemic. I took a total of 2 days off. There were breakouts within my place of work. I never demanded respect and demanded to work mobile and refused to see my customers. Yet that’s exactly what doctors did. They skirted their responsibilities. It is absolutely shameful. That’s why they have lost my respect.",-0.9555,2

Borrelia (the cause of Lyme disease), 
Chlamydia, 
Coxsackie B viruses, 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
Epstein-Barr virus, 
Excess alcohol consumption, 
fungal and parasitic infections, 
Hepatitis C, 
Herpes, 
HIV, 
Influenza, 
Parvovirus, 
Mycoplasma (bacteria that cause a lung infection), 
Streptococcal (strep) bacteria, 
Staphylococcal (staph) bacteria - MRSA, and
Treponema (the cause of syphilis). 
Other causes include certain chemicals or allergic reactions to medications or toxins like:
Drugs (cocaine and amphetamines, and prescription drugs such as blood thinners), 
Lead, 
spider bites, 
wasp stings, and 
snake bites.
An autoimmune disease that causes inflammation throughout your body, like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, may also lead to myocarditis. 

People were inducing disease in themselves and getting checked out more than normal if they thought they had covid. If it is pericarditis, it goes away within 3 months if it's not going to kill you. A bad cold can cause mild cases of pericarditis as well. It [occasionally](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29728118/) happens as a result of the flu shot, too. Trans fat consumptions can cause [inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16713393/)
of the pericardium and endocardium (epithelial heart tissue). Ischemic heart disease can be caused by excess processed red meat consumption, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, and excessive alcohol. Many of which rose during this 15months. 
Medicines can cause side effects that may lead to myocarditis, pericarditis, or both, as well.
Some causes of endocarditis include : Antibiotics, such as penicillin, 
antidepressants (such as tricyclic antidepressants), 
Benzodiazepines, such as Xanax (commonly gotten on the street), 
diuretics, 
heart medicines, 
psychiatric medicines (such as clozapine and lithium), 
vaccines, and
weight-loss medicines, (such as phentermine-fenfluramine or phen-fe). 
Show me evidence of very frequent (more frequent than normal according to the history for 2010-2020 as well) cases of heart inflammation among ""unvaccinated"" people with no prior heart conditions, new or old bad habits, or previous infections that may have damaged their heart, happening right now as a direct result of a ""symptomatic covid19 infection"". Further, show, if there are any, that the small number of cases of heart inflammation in ""unvaccinated"" people that eat well, exercise well, hadn't had pneumonia or a bad flu or cold within the last few years, and consume no recreational drugs (or pharmaceutical ones that cause heart inflammation) is more than the number of cases in ""vaccinated"" individuals that were previously healthy with good habits and no existing conditions or infections.",0.9696,5

It has nothing to do with a vaccine. And most people are immune already. And this disease also does not spread asymptomatic.

The current epidemic is based on PCR tests that used the wrong cycles to artificially increase the rate of ""infections"" with &gt;95% false positives. The vaccines appear to work, because these cycles are set down to more normal levels, only for those who are vaccinated.

There are even indications that vaccines lower the resistance against the disease, exactly as we saw in animal trials.

If we set the PCR tests to normal levels there is no epidemic. And if we use the medicine that actually work, like those listed on http://c19study.com , we can actually help the 0.01% people that do get health problems. A far more sane choice than turning everyone into lab-rats.",0.6309,7

Coronavirus is an efficient balance between killing and spreading. Even worse because so many are asymptomatic so you can spread it all over unknowingly.

Leaked conversation of Lancet and NEJM Editors-In-Chief reveals they already know Big Pharma is a “criminal” cartel pushing rigged science for profit

http://archive.is/6gdy1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

French audio with English subtitles — Richard Horton, the Editor-In-Chief of The Lancet, says:
“Now we are not going to be able to, basically, if this continues, publish any more clinical research data because the pharmaceutical companies are so financially powerful today, and are able to use such methodologies, as to have us accept papers which are apparently methodologically perfect, but which, in reality, manage to conclude what they want them to conclude.”

--Paraphrased, this means Big Pharma can rig any data necessary to achieve publication of junk science in the journals.

“The U.S. is an international outlier on HCQ,” the paper says. “Right now, doctors around the world are prescribing HCQ to treat COVID-19 outside of hospitals, as well as prophylactically to prevent infection among healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. This paper argues that HCQ has met the appropriate burden of proof and urges members of the U.S. news media, public health community, and regulatory agencies to stop politicizing the use of this medicine. Tens of thousands of lives still hang in the balance.”

I'll give you that, because I misspoke (well typed)- I should've said ""almost no risk"" rather than ""no risk"". But the chances that a child will die from a car crash is significantly higher than them dying from getting Covid. So I do think that it's ironic that most people will pack up their child to do pick up services at the store, but are too afraid to actually go in the store. 

&gt;searched for this 82 bacterial colonies and 4 mold colonies study. Can’t find it.

I have a [study from 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903751/) that may be interesting to look at since there's no bias about masks at the time. Then [an article about bacteria growth between surgical masks and cloth masks](https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/don-t-forget-wash-your-mask-experiment-shows-microbes-found-masks-worn-prolonged-periods). 

&gt;Masks do not prevent oxygen exchange, tidal volume or anything else. It’s gas permeable. Watch the videos of people running marathons with masks and O2 saturation stays above 95%.

I watched the Steven Crowder video (I don't think its on YT, but it would be on TheBlaze) where he did a controlled study (him and a female) worked out with no mask, took a break then tried it with a mask. Iirc, they both were 96/97 without a mask and both were under 95 with it. She got down to 90. 


Anyways, I'm too tired to read the rest of your points because I'm chasing around an active little 10 month old and he is trying to eat dirt and stuff. Weird thing is, he gets in the grossest dirtiest things and still hasn't gotten sick (unless you count his teething fever) so I'm gonna continue his diet of breastmilk and random crumbs off the floor lol",-0.9354,2

My daughter will be 2 tomorrow. God willing, she will never remember this time. I've tried to keep her life as normal as possible. I even wear my mandated muzzle so that I can take her to gymnastics just for some normalcy in her life (she does not have to wear one and she never will).",-0.8018,1

&gt;Universal masking at MGB was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among HCWs. This association may be related to a decrease in transmission between patients and HCWs and among HCWs. The decrease in HCW infections could be confounded by other interventions inside and outside of the health care system (Figure), such as restrictions on elective procedures, social distancing measures, and increased masking in public spaces, which are limitations of this study. Despite these local and statewide measures, the case number continued to increase in Massachusetts throughout the study period,6 suggesting that the decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in MGB HCWs took place before the decrease in the general public. Randomized trials of universal masking of HCWs during a pandemic are likely not feasible. Nonetheless, these results support universal masking as part of a multipronged infection reduction strategy in health care settings.

Why are people still virtue-signaling with masks? Why are they pushing for ‘vaccine passports’? Why the new ‘scariants’ (scary new variants of covid)? Covid was just the beginning. 

They want to use this as an excuse to do more; to take more freedoms. Mark my words: ‘climate lockdowns’ are next. Beef consumption will be restricted. Personal vehicle use will be restricted. Only ‘essential’ jobs will get to leave home to work. Everyone else will work from home if possible, or get a free government check. UBI (Universal Basic Income) will be introduced. Taxes will double or more to pay for it. They’re creating their own cryptocurrency and issuing government bank accounts for everyone. All taxes will be paid this way. All refunds will be issued this way. This will replace the dollar.",0.5834,5

*""The report, published Tuesday by advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless, found that the age-adjusted mortality rate for sheltered homeless people in New York City was 321 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a citywide average of 200 deaths per 100,000 people.*

*Mortality rates were higher for the roughly 19,000 single adults living in dormitory-style shelters where social distancing often isn’t possible, the report’s authors found.*

So I know maths are hard for the NYT, so here were go:

**homeless people in New York City was 321 deaths per 100,000 people**

so that is = 3.21/10,000

Next Sentance:

**Mortality rates were higher for the roughly 19,000 single adults**

so lets round that up to 20K*(3.21/10,000)= 6.42 People

a STatistically insignificant number, non-attributable to actually being homeless

The numbers show that with the larger percentage of total deaths we are now getting rid of our masks that are oh so helpful in the stopping of transmission that, now, we are able to do away with them if vaxxed. However after being vaxxed, you can still catch covid.

And yes the VAERS is by its own admission unreliable and shouldn't be used to prove side effects of vaccines. I don't feel like that's an argument I need to defend, since the VAERS agrees with me lol. 

From their website 👇
										 										

Limitations of VAERS:

It is generally not possible to find out from VAERS data if a vaccine caused the adverse event

Reports submitted to VAERS often lack details and sometimes contains errors

Serious adverse events are more likely to be reported than non-serious events

Numbers of reports may increase in response to media attention and increased public awareness

VAERS data cannot be used to determine rates of adverse events

The problem with a lot of these papers as well is that although they are using a pretty high starting sample size, you still have a low rate of ILI throughout that population so it's hard to get good statistical power, in the first study only 34 cases were positively identified. 
Even fewer in the 4th.

A large scale meta-analysis looking at the body of literature said:

&gt;We did not identify any experimental volunteer studies that investigated whether surgical masks or N95 respirators could protect against infection. 

So there is a lack of well designed experimental studies.




However they identify one paper that is more experimental.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19522650/

&gt;We identified one experimental study of face mask performance which involved participants with confirmed influenza virus infection [7], and the results suggested that surgical masks may be able to reduce infectiousness.

And there has been this more recently and focusing on coronaviruses.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2

&gt;Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets. Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals.


And when you get the very large scale epidemiological studies there seems to be a body of evidence developing to support mask wearing to reduce transmission. Although here is only a small selection of them. 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231v5

&gt;Societal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from COVID-19.

https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818

&gt;The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00003-0/fulltext
&gt;For preventing transmission, non-targeted interventions, such as face masks, are especially important given the high proportion of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases and the risk of transmission from these individuals, and from the presymptomatic period.

https://www.pnas.org/content/117/51/32293

&gt;Weighing various estimates, we conclude that 20 d after becoming mandatory face masks have reduced the number of new infections by around 45%

https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118

&gt;Our review of the literature offers evidence in favor of widespread mask use as source control to reduce community transmission: Nonmedical masks use materials that obstruct particles of the necessary size; people are most infectious in the initial period postinfection, where it is common to have few or no symptoms (45, 46, 141); nonmedical masks have been effective in reducing transmission of respiratory viruses; and places and time periods where mask usage is required or widespread have shown substantially lower community transmission.

These studies have a lot of limitations on their own, but together the evidence seems to be pointing in one direction.

Can you just fucking imagine how many people alive would be responsible for murder if you tallied up all the people who’ve gone to crowded places with a light sore throat during flu season and most likely spread a germ that ultimately ended in someone dying from it? And old people PLUS young babies and kids are far more susceptible to the flu and actually dying from it. No one wonders who spread it or who was responsible. That’s not a conversation people have.

But I’ve literally seen people say that someone who doesn’t wear a mask or goes to a restaurant and potentially, unknowingly spreads Covid should be charged for murder. DOES ANYONE HEAR THEMSELVES?!?!?! I would rather get covid than the damn flu. The flu took me way closer to death than covid and I was 10 years younger when it almost did me in. Covid was a 3 week nuisance that felt like prolonged bronchitis. At least I wasn’t delirious with a 105 fever.

I am not responsible for anyone’s health. It is not my responsibility to RUIN my life for a stranger. I have given up everything. Everything I lived for, that made working hard worth it, that gave me a zest for life, that gave me something to look forward to, has been taken. Time with my niece that I can never get back has been taken, and I was really goddamn excited to hold that kid and be there for so much of her infancy but nope. Taken. For complete strangers, a huge amount who wouldn’t just as soon succumbed to the flu. Sure there are outliers regarding Covid. No doubt it has taken some prematurely. Shit like scarlet fever still swoops in and kills otherwise healthy 35 year olds sometimes. We don’t take everything from the population when that happens. 

The people who are most scared just seem to regurgitate the same lines and they seem so completely mentally confident in their decision to give up absolutely everything and getting that pushed on me is mind numbing. I am selfish and I am so fucking tired of being asked to give up my life because someone else doesn’t want to take responsibility of their own perception a current event and personal risk assessment.",-0.9943,29

SS -""This means that at this temperature it is inert or not active. That means at -70C there is a very limited amount of latent and/or kinetic energy that can be expressed.

If it were an explosive, biological material, a virus or bacteria that could rapidly grow, **a biological nano-machine** that had to stay in stasis until delivered that would all make sense but a simple vaccine with common adjuvants does not add up. 

The only time I have seen injectable material that had to be maintained at these kinds of extreme temperatures it was a modeled AIDS-like virus used to transport RNA to other cells, meaning a biological engine used to splice DNA and alter the genetic material of the target cells.

I know what happens with binary replication in cellular transport systems. The first injected virus changes a cell, which creates 2 copies, those 2 copies change 2 cells which creates 4 copies, it doubles at each interaction. At some point half the body changes the other half and the host dies.""

*This was info by someone listed as Dave Meckanic online and I found it very interesting so I looked into this RNA vaccine situation more.  

""A new class of vaccines, “RNA vaccines”, has recently been developed. RNA vaccines rely on a different way to mimic infection. Compared to previous vaccines, this method is more robust, more versatile, and yet, equally efficient. Therefore, the RNA vaccine technology holds great promise to prevent and treat a wide range of diseases, such as influenza or cancer.

Have you heard about RNA vaccines? This technology recently made the news when the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation invested $53 million in the German company, CureVac, which specializes in the development of these vaccines"" - Graduate Student Group at the Harvard Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences.

""mRNA vaccines, trick the body into producing some of the viral proteins itself. They work by using mRNA, or messenger RNA, which is the molecule that essentially puts DNA instructions into action. Inside a cell, mRNA is used as a template to build a protein. ‘An mRNA is basically like a pre-form of a protein and its (sequence encodes) what the protein is basically made of later on,’ said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.

""To produce an mRNA vaccine, scientists produce a synthetic version of the mRNA that a virus uses to build its infectious proteins. This mRNA is delivered into the human body, whose cells read it as instructions to build that viral protein, and therefore create some of the virus’s molecules themselves. These proteins are solitary, so they do not assemble to form a virus. The immune system then detects these viral proteins and starts to produce a defensive response to them.

Because mRNA vaccines are only now beginning to be tested in humans, there are a lot of fairly basic unknowns which can only be answered through human trials. ‘What is really the current challenge, I think, is to understand whether these vaccines will really be able to mount a sufficiently protective immune response in the human and to understand, for example, which quantities of mRNA will be needed to do this,’ said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.

Other outstanding questions include whether the proteins that have been chosen for the vaccine are the right ones to prevent a coronavirus infection in the body, how targeted the immune response is to this particular coronavirus, how long any immunity would last, and whether it causes side-effects such as increased inflammatory responses like redness and swelling or, in the worst case, aggravates disease."" - Horozen the EU research and innovation magazine",0.9909,1

It ""inconveniences"" you, lmao, you are putting lives in danger because it inconveniences you, that is just great. Give my best of luck wishes to your toddler, it will need all it can get with someone like you as their mother.

It doesnt kill the environment, i dont see why you keep saying it, there are thousands of other issues, and you choose the smallest one which also has the greatest benefit, nice one, why dont you go yell at the cars driving down the road or the meat industry if you care so much about the environment.

Again with the unformed brain crap, here you are crying about a mask and putting lives in danger because it inconveniences you. It was your choice to get pregnant during covid, so why are you deciding everyone else should be put at risk because you decided this was the perfect time to fuck without a condom. I love the insults about being a child, it seems to be that and face trash as the only things you can think off.

If you dont want to wear a mask, maybe get vaccinated, or just dont go outside until you had the baby so you can wear the mask like a normal person of society.

Just say you are a selfish cunt and stop trying to justify it, im not trying to justify my child labour phone, i know kids slaved over it in some asian country so why cant you just say that you are weaker than a 16 year old and a piece of cloth is enough to mildly inconvenience you to a point of putting others in danger instead of just, ya know, staying inside.

I don't think that applies here honestly. If you look at what Karl Marx envisioned communism to be and compare it to what we've seen from the likes of Stalin, or Mao it just isn't the same thing at all. 

&gt;There has been , and still is today communist and socialist governments.

I disagree wholeheartedly. 

&gt;They have a lot more authority over their citizens than capitalist societies. 

Which is one of the prime reasons they can't be considered socialist or communist. 

You are taking the propaganda that is taught in American schools and trying to reason out the reality of these countries through that lens. It's just not useful to discussion at all. I'm not sure you are doing it on purpose or are being disingenuous like I've seen others here very clearly be, but the result is still the same. A massive disconnect between people who understand what communism/socialism are supposed to be and people who understand what communism/socialism are according to capitalistic propaganda that we've had through generations of schooling here in America. 

I think you need to understand that I'm defending ideas that have never actually been practiced on a massive scale. I'm not defending the typically brought-up examples of authoritarian governments you are likely thinking of.

&gt;if you tell everyone they can get everything for free whether they work or not, too many people will choose not to work when you apply this to a large group of people. 

Well, that's just not born out in data of any kind. People largely want to work or do something they enjoy to occupy their time in life. Very few people don't. 

&gt;So either they literally starve to death, OR they are forced to work, an authority will have to force them to work, while commanding the economy

There would actually be basic needs covered by an actual communist or socialist government though so nobody would be starving to death. People wouldn't be forced to work shit jobs they don't enjoy doing. It would actually incentivize more creativity and expand careers in the arts and other typically undervalued jobs in a capitalist system. 

&gt;Your Ilhan Omar tweet

I took that as her saying ""we need to dismantle certain ideas of what capitalism IS"" not dismantle capitalism altogether. But hey if she meant dismantle capitalism that only makes me love her more than I already do. Would have to get her to clarify that though.

&gt;The DSA recently took over the Nevada Democrat party elected positions (not elected politicians) 

That's great! And they were elected. Not sure what you meant by ""not elected politicians"". But my original point remains. There really are not many democratic socialists in American politics, and regardless democratic socialism isn't socialism and sure isn't communism. If you look at any of their platforms it resembles social democratic positions much more than dem socialist positions. But for some reason in America, these two terms and very different political ideologies have been conflated a lot. 

&gt; I also tend to rotate my news media sources

On top of what you already mentioned I would recommend AP News, Secular Talk, The Intercept, Jacobin, Democracy NOW, The Majority Report, The Rational National, David Pakman, Breaking points (which is Krystal and Saargar from the hill's rising) and to really hammer home what I'm trying to get across here I would recommend Democracy at work, (or anything with Richard Wolff) as well as going back and watching TMBS episodes with the late Michael Brooks. Vaush is also just incredibly articulate and intelligent but covers more than just politics. 

All of your sources are fine (except tim pool that guy is trash lol). I used to be a fan of Jimmy Dore and while he's been right about neolibs like Biden and Clinton for years his anger and resentment as more recently been thrown falsely at the likes of AOC and younger members of congress. I watch him but take everything he has to say with a grain of salt because he really does let his emotions dictate his youtube content, unfortunately.",0.9854,1

With such high Ct values necessary to detect viral RNA it suggests that the patient had low quantities of viral infiltration in these organs, especially considering the usual cut off point for PCR cycling is 40. Unsurprisingly, the viral RNA was detected in the lungs with a much lower Ct value at only 26.5. 

I might also add that that the patient was an elderly gentleman at 86 years of age with a history of systemic arterial hypertension, chronic venous insufficiency, dementia and prostate carcinoma and based on the patient's age and cancer diagnosis it wouldn't be surprising if he had immunosenescence as well.",-0.443,3

I'm someone who's still trying to figure out what's true and what's false in all of this, so I'm not committed to either side of the argument.  But I do know something's wrong when reasonable people are being prevented from voicing their thoughts and feelings.

T'was a week or two ago that I saw a woman posting to one of the medical subreddits.  She had just received one of the Covid vaccines and was experiencing uncontrollable tremors, so of course she was worried.  She posted to this medical subreddit merely asking if anyone else who'd received the vaccine had experienced the same thing, was it normal, did she need to be concerned.  She even stated that she wasn't against vaccines, and was merely worried about these tremors.  It didn't escape me that she'd felt the need to make that clear about herself - that she wasn't an 'anti-vaxxer'.  Anyhow, I was curious about what responses she would get, so I saved the post.  Except her post was deleted within minutes, without so much as even one response.

Now how is that kind of thing supposed to not set off alarms for someone who's searching for the truth in all of this.  (Rhetorical question)

The silent war is about democracy and free market economy vs socialism/communism that is currently being played out globally... The global deep state seems hell bent on communism, the great reset article by the davos creator says it all. He called it stake holder capitalism, the rest call it socialism. There is this massive push to increase government control on our movements/rights and on the economy itself.

Free market and capitalist old guard vs the European/American socialist... Look at the amount of "" late stage capitalism "" being tossed around or how universal basic income and socialism is great all of sudden... Like Jamie Dimon said, I don't think people understand what socialism is, it's not only about governments controlling entire economies, it's also about the lack of voting and democracy.

You cannot name one country in the world who went under a socialist or communist banner and held elections. Debate anyone about why communism never worked anywhere in the world even one time, there response seem to always be that it wasn't "" true "" communism.

Communism is a much bigger threat to the human population then the lockdown hoax and yet so few are talking about it. Don't get me wrong, the global lockdown hoax is crap and there push to mandatory vaccines and other oppressing shit is non sense, but socialism is the end game. By the time 2030 rolls out, the technology available to governments will make oppression a cakewalk. Look at china, you can't even fart without a camera observing you.",-0.1378,43

I don't find joy in any situation that masks are involved and nothing is fun anymore, so I understand how you feel.

People outside the metro area don't care as much if you don't wear a mask and it's easier to go maskless in these areas. I have not been brave enough to do this where I live out of fear that I'll end up on the internet and get publicly shamed. I frequently let my face covering fall down while shopping though but will pull it back up if someone tells me to. If you see someone else not wearing one, maybe pull yours off too and/or let them know you support them. I always immediately remove my face covering upon leaving a store. I will not wear it a second longer than I have to and I refuse to wear one outside (and that includes parking lots/ramps/garages). The more people wear masks outside, the more normalized a faceless society become.

Regarding schooI: I would not try being a maskless lone wolf in school as a protest statement (because it will only get you in trouble), but if other students agree with you, go to the administration and/or have your parents threaten to pull you out because of the mask rules. School districts do not want to lose students. If you do distance learning, maybe continue to do distance learning (if that's an option). In-person school looks like it sucks right now anyways. I think that it would be great if people refused to work and go to school as long as they are forced to wear masks, but that's risky because people could end up losing their jobs.

If someone yells at you, don't yell in return. Calmly remind them that yelling forcefully expels the the droplets that carry Covid and if they cared about spreading Covid, the best thing they could do would be to keep their distance and breathe quietly. If you're in a store and are politely asked to pull your mask up, I'd comply. Walking away also works. 

I too am SO happy and grateful this Reddit community exists. Almost my entire social group is pro-mask and pro-restrictions and I need to vent to people who understand and won't attack me for having a different opinion and questioning the CDC.

 Right in the comment you responded to I referred to a study where it says explicitly that masks are effective at preventing aerosolised particles from spreading. Didn't you read that?

&gt;I get you want to “win” something here but without acknowledging that there is no consensus in the science community, you can’t really establish any credibility or willingness to actually debate or discuss the issues. 

Complete consensus never exists, there is always someone that will be in disagreement.

The idiots on this sub just think they're special and don't want to wear masks cause they're selfish pricks that don't seem to understand that there are people who are essential workers, but also have difficult illnesses, which make them vulnerable. 

This means that there is a surprising amount of people who are in a high risk group (couple of my friends included, who can't work due to a limited immune system, but have to because they will starve otherwise) whose lives rely on people wearing masks. Sure, the odds of them dying are low, but after effects are brutal and few young people can go on today with months off work.

So please wear a mask. Even if you think you're safe, you're wearing it to protect others. It's our societal duty to protect the weak. To do otherwise is evil. Especially if all it costs is a mask for 10-20 minutes when you're in a store somewhere surrounded by other people and maybe outside around someone for more than 5-10 minutes.

NoNewNormal is a sub for the selfish and the cruel, people that do not feel compassion, but only greed and love for themselves, whose pride is so large that they can't even bother wearing a mask. They don't care about the old or the sick, only about themselves. 

I hope no one on this sub or their relatives or friends  catches Covid, cause it sucks. 

Hell, each bed in the ICU occupied by a Covid patient because someone 2 social links from them didn't wear a mask is a bed where someone else could lie on, someone else in danger can be saved. A child may die because a preventable disease is taking up their space.

Edit: I know I'll get tons of downvotes and comments denouncing this, perhaps even a ban, but if my message gets to one of the people here, then I may have saved a life. **You** may have saved a life.

&gt; The model projected that if people make significant behavior changes after the state makes its dial framework advisory, hospitalizations could increase to 1,562. If that happened, it wouldn’t be as bad as during the fall wave, when nearly 2,000 people were hospitalized on the peak day in December, but it would once again exceed the previous peak in April 2020.

The headline is just the Denver Post fearmongering with the best.

Edited:  I originally had simply written covid was unchanged.  The change in seven day average for new hospitalizations is 0.  The number of new cases is declining.

It’s funny sometimes we need to step back and remind ourselves what we are arguing about. I was making some points to my sister about how dumb masks are and she had to remind me that even if masks do work 100% I wouldn’t have to wear one because I’m not ill. Jesus, I’ve been arguing this for a year now I forget some of the fundamental points I started out with.

Asymptomatic spread is a complete fabrication of which nobody has been able to present me with any decent evidence (no, I do not consider that Korean flight study conclusive. 1 is not a sample size anybody takes seriously in science send me something else doomers). 

Bonus if anyone is still reading: what do you think they are doing with the vaccine? Let’s talk through what they openly admit the vaccine doesn’t do. It doesn’t stop you spreading covid, it doesn’t stop you getting covid, it just suppresses severe symptoms. Are you seeing what I’m seeing? Soon it won’t be a lie about asymptomatic spread because they are literally making people asymptomatic spreaders. Now I don’t know how far I go believing any of their bullshit but this is what you can work out if you have a brain from literally using the “facts” they present us with and it still doesn’t make any sense.

I can't ""prove"" it was done everywhere, I just saw it online in various places and saw news reports and such.

The first time I saw it was videos in China where people were imprisoned in those awful tenement buildings, and people were cheering something out the windows. Someone posted it on Reddit saying it was solidarity between the people victimized by the lockdowns there, and someone else responded, ""No, this is a thing they're doing there to celebrate the healthcare workers"" or whatever.

But then I saw ""grassroots"" attempts at trying to get people to do it on [Nextdoor.com](https://Nextdoor.com) ... And I THINK there were some ""promoted posts"" encouraging it. Advertisements.

And I'm in San Diego and I see billboards here and there celebrating healthcare workers for risking their lives to save ours, blahblahblah.

There's definitely something fishy about it.

What I've learned is --- there's no such thing as ""grassroots spread."" It is encouraged, one way or another. Either through PR firms or social media companies boosting certain things based on keyboards and checkmarked status figures.

The onus isn't on me to disprove your opinions and claims on things that clearly didn't happen. You've done the classic gaslighting, taken actual events and then added in your own segments of bullshit to completely twist the narrative. I'll give you one example of the many that are littered throughout the biased, unsubstantiated nonsense you have churned out.

'He described not only how he managed to make himself thé expert on the “Swine Flu” that everyone in the Belgian media used as a reliable source, but also how he deliberately deceived the Belgian public to generate an atmosphere of fear around the “Swine Flu”.'


Have a guess which part of that statement is not only completely false, but also changes a conversation about how to message swine flu into how how someone has completely, deliberately controlled the narrative of a message and over exaggerates a minor disease.

The entire crux of the discussion has been changed all because you added in 'how he deliberately deceived the Belgian public to generate an atmosphere of fear'. That is alarmist, conspiratorial, not factual and in fact complete bullshit you have added to fit your narrative.

Your entire rant is filled with such nonsense and it is one of the reasons you people are not, and will not ever be take seriously by normal people.

When I was working in fast food I was the slave to every stupid policy my owner demanded. We weren’t allowed to do anything. One time there was a protest near our store and he came over and said, “no one is allowed to be seen near the protestors,”. He didn’t want his business being associated with anything that could make customers associate us with an idea they may possibly disagree with and then lose business. Our shirts had to be tucked in, we had to wear baseball caps, we had to greet people with the same robotic line, we had to answer the phone the same damn way every time. If customers were scum to us we had to smile and serve them. One time I had a guy say, “fuck you!” when I forgot his ranch dressing and offered to give him a refund because we were out. Instead of blacklisting this clearly hostile dude, we gave him some free food. So my point is, more of these workers enforcing mask policy probably think it’s bullshit just as much as us but they can’t even think about doing otherwise or hinting to others. Franchise owners are crafty and who knows who a customer is, it could be a plant testing our compliance. Health inspectors came in all the time unannounced to assess our compliance. There are security cameras all over places like this and don’t think the owner doesn’t watch footage and inspect worker behavior. This is what led me to believe franchise companies are poison to society and to their workers. If you go to a place where everyone dresses the same and they all speak from a script, they ARE NOT ALLOWED TO THINK ON THEIR OWN. So please stop harassing them, they will lose their job. It’s okay to talk shit about policy, but don’t make them try to go against their ridiculous rules, because they could actually lose their job. The only sure way to get any possible change is to send letters to the OWNERS of the establishment, not managers, not supervisors, but the local owner, even the CEO of the franchise.

I’m not trying to argue with you, but you came on here to complain about the exact tyranny you were begging for months ago. You opened with “I’m a militant leftist.” What did you expect from people? We wouldn’t bring that up? 

And, I DO get to have an opinion, I live a couple hours away, I grew up there, and my parents are there, so stop gatekeeping NYC like you own it. You don’t. 

I also have a Governor just like Cuomo (one of the fab 5) so I get to have an opinion about similar governance. You and I may not agree, but I absolutely get to have an opinion. Stop trying to censor and shout people down because you don’t like what they have to say. 

If you want to talk about assumptions, you should check your own. I live in a very liberal area. I’ve also never in my life used the word “libtard” because it’s offensive, so don’t put that in my mouth. 

You brought in stereotypes when you referred to Nantucket and now you are upset I fired them right back at you? Pull some research on the type of people who have homes in Nantucket. See where they work, I can assure you I am not far off on this. 

As far as brainwashing goes, just review the data. Even ridiculous CNN put out a report a little while back that there has been a huge shift in the conservative movement. It IS now the working class movement.

As far as bootlicking goes, I’ve never heard libertarians called bootlickers? It’s the exact opposite of the philosophy. Bootlickers generally follow authority - they would be the ones wearing 5 masks and begging big daddy government for help.",-0.7886,3

""Based on extensive review and analysis, there is no question in my mind that healthy people should not be wearing surgical or cloth masks. Nor should we be recommending universal masking of all members of the population.""

Masks don't work well, but especially in the fashion an overwhelming majority of them are being used.
We are wearing bacteria collecting shit rags on our face. All in the name of health. Its literally the stupidest thing we could do. 

Meanwhile a year into the pandemic and not one single word on how to improve your health. Despite the fact that approximately 80% of the Hospitalizations are coming from people who are obese. 

The simple fact is we wouldn't be in a ""Pandemic"" if half the country weren't obese sitting home stuffing their face with Booze, soda, and take out while sitting their lazy asses at home and using ""the pandemic"" as an excuse to not go to the gym or even work out at all.

Source? Some countries didn't and the media just ignores them. It's interesting to see the focus on India for several reasons:

1. No one gives a fuck about India. This country has been fucked sideways for hundreds of years. No one cares. A lot of regular horrible shit that happens there is not even considered newsworthy most of the time.
2. India has laws and jail time for folks who disobey the rules.
3. It comes at the same time as the vaccine program.
4. There are countries much worse off than India, including most of Europe and the US, but the media makes India out as the be all and end all of catastrophes. 

But the basic premise of your question is kind of odd:

\&gt;If the masks and vaccines are about control, then why is it a worldwide thing?

If business is about making money, why do all businesses try to make money? Gotcha!

That's not true! Look at the stats for places that have had no lockdowns! Then look at the suicide, world poverty, starvation, domestic abuse, opiate addiction, homeless, self-harm, education and mental health stats globally! 

&gt;I assume at the beginning of the pandemic you were taking every precaution because the word was that this virus was really bad

No. [Here](https://ibb.co/WgNmvhk) is what I was telling people in March, 2020. 

&gt;Individuals don't have the resources to properly identify a pandemic and then react to it.

Yes we do. We all have access to the same information. 

&gt;since there will be a non-uniform response many people will act as ""super spreaders"" because in their mind the virus has not reached their threshold.

And they'll only be spreading it to others who have ascertained that the risk is not worth precautionary measures. If I wanted to protect myself, there are N-95s, face shields, hand sanitatizers, and delivery services available. I've never utilized any of those because I've never given much of a shit and when I had Covid I realized how justified I was. Don't worry...I quarantined because I am polite. 

&gt;Point 3 is that even if every person agreed on ""severe enough"" the rate of react would vary because maybe they didn't see the news or something like that

No agreement needed. If there is an Ebola outbreak and Johnny and Linda are dicking around at a party, they are going to die and it is no one's problem aside from those who have attended a party during an Eblola outbreak. 

You'll say, ""but the cashier at the beer store didn't attend the party and doesn't deserve to die!"" Right...and he has the ability to wear a surgical mask, a facial shield, gloves and sanitize. Moreover, plenty of such cashiers were forced out of work against their will ANYWAY. In the event of an Ebola outbreak with no government intervention, they could choose to leave work, or stay. 

&gt;. If I read there was a 0.001% death rate but at the same time every expert kept saying ""please practice social distancing, wear masks etc"" I still would because they simply know more than me about this topic. I nor you can learn enough just by trolling the web.

But every expert *wasn't* saying that. There are tens of thousands who have been decrying the measures taken for sooooo long. Please duck-duck-go ""The Barrington Declaration."" 

&gt;because lots was done this time and still 600,000 people died

Look at Germany where you can't even go shopping without a negative corona test. The EU has become a fucking fascist dystopia. Compared to that - the Netherlands is not that bad after all. Trust me. Vaccine is out of question.  But if you don't mind getting tested, you can go to a concert and be there inside without the fucking diaper and without the ridiculous 1,5 metres bullshit.  I'm saying, you guys in the Netherlands, you still have it pretty good. Yes, your government screwed the curfew which was utterly useless and stupid, and yes, they caved in to the mainstream media pressure regarding masks. The Dutch government had held firm almost the whole last year, your Prime Minister called the masks childish... but in the end they surrendered to the pressure.  Still, the masks were never mandatory outdoors. Compare it to almost every other country in the EU, and you will start appreciating the Dutch way. It's not perfect, the Netherlands could have been a second Sweden, but your politicians crumbled... still, they never fully embraced the fascist dystopia like in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Belgium... you name it. One fucking corona fascist dictatorship after another.  The Dutch are different. They appreciate their freedom and liberties.  I think life will be back to normal in the Netherlands sooner rather than later.  BTW - congrats for politicians like Thierry Baudet. He is a breath of fresh air among these spineless corrupt stupid hypocritical opportunistic sons of bitches (=politicians).",-0.7128,3

That’s why we’re able to take it now. And that’s fine. Some people (my SO included) have bad inflammatory reactions to vaccines. But to say it’s dangerous is stupid. There wasn’t long term research on any of the vaccines when they first started being administered. It has to be used for a long time to have long time research.

Most insurance does not cover injuries due to EUA vaccines.

Employers mandating it are under no obligation to file a workers compensation claim if you are injured by these vaccines.

Moreover in the “vaccine court”, if they choose to even allow you to make a claim, the burden is on the injured to prove the vaccine is the cause of their injury.

So if you are say an 18 year old athlete is peak health you might be able to prove the MRNA vaccine gave you myocarditis and have your hospital bills covered.

If you are an overweight 40 year old you are pretty much shit out of luck because they can point to your weight being the cause of the heart condition.

If your school or employer mandates vaccination here are some forms you can hand to the HR department to require them to fill out.

It serves two purposes 1) it clarifies if you have coverage and 2) it forces liability onto the employer/university for knowingly mandating the vaccine.

I wonder why the government wouldn’t want people to see the overwhelming amount of evidence that their rushed vaccine that didn’t have to meet any safety standards that normally draw out the development pipeline to over a decade is harming a record number of recipients...?

Enjoy injecting their science experiment and still having to wear a mask, social distance, and having no proof of immunity.

Another issue is that we are now discovering that the primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality is due to the pathological reaction of the immune system to the spike protein and not to the virus itself. This suggests why younger people with less developed immune systems don't really have problems with covid19 as much. Whereas older people with dysregulated adaptive immune systems do

And that's the protein for which the mRNA and adenoviral vaccine codes for.   


Another issue is that there likely is a ""bug"" in the code. In order to make the vaccine safer and to keep the spike protein in the muscle tissue and not let it spread into systemic circulation, they added a transmembrane domain to the mRNA  for moderna and pfizer and DNA code (for adenoviral vector). This in ""theory"" keeps the spike protein on the cell surface membrane and not become soluble. Issue is that mRNA is unstable, and that domain can disintergrate as well as other parts of the mRNA, DNA has issues of alternative splicing and can cause truncation of the transmembrane domain. Well that will cause soluble spike proteins to be produced, which can leak into systemic circulation and cause a variety of issues from blood clots to heart inflammation, to fertility issues depending on how your immune system reacts to the spike protein.

After a FOIA request, a biodistribution study which was done in Japan was released and it shows that the protein does not stay in the muscle tissue and goes into systemic circulation. This is in animal studies but not completely translatable to humans but based on the biodistrubution data, it hints to why some people are having these issues.

The reason I ask, is this. The argument from the left is always that “no vaccine is 100% effective.” This is obviously true. But most widely used and accepted vaccines have about a 3-5% fail rate. So if the vaccine is working at a 95-97% rate then why would all of these stories keep popping. We can’t trust the CDC to give real stats so I wonder what the number is. Most sane people wouldn’t take the experimental jab if they knew it had a much lower success rate then the flu vaccine.

But its crazy how bad gen Z and millenials have it already, and how bleak their prospects look.  We make 1/2 of what our parents generation did, and the cost of owning a home is more prohibitive than ever.  China is going to surpass our GDP even sooner than expected now and are now breaking into tech sectors, which is all we have left after throwing away manufacturing jobs overseas.  And of course there are concerns of rapid inflation, but I think its going to be more of a slow bleed as we decline from our status as #1 superpower.

Maybe you should ask them where did they get the sequence so quickly. Maybe you also check their credential the head of that corrupt organization is not even a physician. Its a mockery to cites these assholes considering they are the ones responsible for the massive outbreak. There is nothing racist about restricting travel to and from China. The WHO said it was racist to do so and they also said China is handling it perfectly and are an example for the rest of the world. Amazing its 2021 China is still reporting 81,000. You buy that number I fucking dont.

Am literally arguing actually science the fact that RNA sequences change and cause the protein expression to also fucking change is a fact. We literally have evidence of mutations in people that prove this its called intron mutations. Where the SnRNA doesn’t doesnt remove introns correctly causing a nonfunctional protein.

Apply the same concept to viruses. You get a different S peptide. I dont mean this in a prideful way but for the love of god do your research before spewing nonsense. Its been proven to death that RNA viruses never had a vaccine. Not even the fucking flu has a vaccine all of these shots dont prevent infection. t cells arent that smart you change a few nucleotides and bam they dont know what they fuck they are looking at. Hints the fact that the current variant bypass neutralising antibodies. 

Which makes fucking right.... its not about you the info flouting online is fucking horse shit. Even youtube is censoring doctors who echo the same thing it was never about science its about control of info. Dumb populations comply with anything.

To make myself utterly clear am not talking about wabble mutations. I am talking about out right deleterious mutations and replacement of amino acids. Those will 100% give you a slight different s1 and s2 peptide. I am not even going to go further with the whole furin cleavage site because thats just a whole lot of mess. All I can tell you is the shit that is online right now is just damage control. This virus was probably man made. You dont have to believe me but there are others who argued the same thing online. I did my research around detecting this virus with antigen test kits or ELISA biosensors. I think I know what am talking about am very confident in that.

This isn't about my comfort, I have a nice wfh job and kids happily in daycare.

This is about the millions entering depression, poverty, hunger, dying of undiagnosed cancers, unsaved heart attacks, etc. for the sake of a disease that even with bullshit counting isn't worse than a bad flu season.

If we tested everyone for rhinovirus and called every death with a positive pcr a rhinovirus death it would produce the same seasonal numbers.

Uh, how? If I had covid and passed it to one person they could pass it to multiple, and it just escalates. You literally have proof with the US cases vs here in Australia. If we ever have like one case we can definitively prove that they caused multiple cases (if they did actually cause another case, obviously if they stayed in lockdown for 2 weeks its less likely).

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article

5.6R0 meaning you can potentially spread it to 5-6 people on average. Then those 5-6 infected can infect 5-6 more.

How do you think covid spreads? I also love the coping with not wearing masks and locking down in america which causes more cases and then they bitch more. Meanwhile we lockdown for a weekend and have to wear masks for like a week afterwards and thats it. I think since the pandemic we have had to wear a mask for a month or two at most due to our governments response and swift action blocking travel in from random countries. We even get to travel to known safe countries nearby which is great as well.",0.8708,-7

And KKK masks aren't mandated, they are worn by cowards with indefensible beliefs, because it is ""mandated"" that the KKK is an illegal organization. Beyond that, while the Democratic Party was the more racist against black people in the past, you'll find that the more of the KKK's current rank and file are Republican than Democrat, if they even believe in democratic principals at all. They're actually fascists and socialists at their core.

So wait, you're saying we didn't learn anything from 1918? (I'm not serious, but this is what you're doing to me.)

Absolutely not true, by the way. The stats are still extremely useful.

&gt;If you introduced it as an example of what you feel is valid threat then I will dismiss that claim for what it is, your feelings and not a valid thing to decide public health policy on

My feelings? Who has the right to draw the line, according to you?

&gt;You’ve provided zero credentials to support your opinion that the at risk are covered.

So now the vaccine is ineffective and the vaccinated should be wearing masks too, got it.

&gt;This entire paragraph is you making a strawman out of my argument. If when I state we should do what’s within reason to save lives that don’t need to be lost as saying we should shut down a quarter of the economy for 1,000 lives that’s your problem not mine.

Again, where do we draw the line? There's opportunity cost here that is completely subjective. I can't remember a time where I couldn't do something because of the Flu, and that kills people too. How many lives triggers the, ""ok let's do something about this"" mark?

The reason as to why many people hate the phrase ""new normal"" is mainly due to implication, especially when you still use the word ""normal"" in your phrasing. If you really wanted to be honest with the wording then the accurate phrase would be ""temporary abnormal"" as it implies what we are doing is not fucking normal and won't last forever. Because ""normal"" implies how we usually live our everyday lives, as when people question ""when can we get back to 'normal'"". Adding the word ""new"" in front of it adds an idea that this is changed. And no, considering how many people lost their jobs due to this shit, no I don't think people can ""lay low"" for a fucking year. Same with social distancing, how the FUCK are movies going to be made with this shit in place? Yes it'll ""end"" eventually, but I highly doubt a shit ton of things can withstand being on hold for more than a fucking year. I see people say shit like ""omg I haven't hugged someone in months"" and it's fucking depressing because of this social distancing crap. Also I live with my grandparents and they literally don't give a shit. It is July and none of us have gotten the virus. As for flattening the curve, lmao that goalpost has been moved. People are literally flipping their shit about rising cases, when flattening the curve was about hospitalizations. Yes you could argue that rising cases = rising hospitalizations, but if the virus has really gotten weaker then we could see low hospitalizations (espeically when the news is losing their shit over the infected being mostly younger people).",-0.9964,14

Some people here fully support Trump, and then some “do not,” as they have been socially programmed by their friends, family, media, etc. to hate him for no logical reason. They’ll say things like “I hate the way he talks/tweets” or “I don’t support anyone” and tbh that’s just a subconscious cop out; neutrality is for the weak. Don’t let anyone fool you.

It takes courage and mental toughness to support Trump in this day and age, and some people just don’t have it in em unfortunately, regardless of their opinions about the virus and the authoritarian government response. 

This is similar to the reasoning behind why we are on the losing end of the lockdown/mask battle over here. You have three types of people: doomers/sheep, anti-mask/anti-lockdown but compliant citizens, and full-on defiant rebels. Therefore, masks and lockdowns continue to win, because the rebels are the minority.

Public health 101 - europeans lived among domesticated animals and their diseases. Native Americans did not.  Living among domesticated animals allowed Europeans exposure to cow pox, which provided protection against smallpox.  When they came to the new land, they brought illness with them that had devastating effects on populations that had not been exposed previously to similar illnesses.

NZ and AUS are vulnerable to the illness.  It still exists in the world.  They will have to keep repeating excessively harsh lockdowns when there is a case because of this.  Perhaps vaccines will work out and they'll have the last laugh, but I just don't see it.

I did skim an article on the Great Barrington Declaration, I want to do my due diligence here but it's also 4am and I'm tired, and the article pointed out that Bhattacharya is supported by 8000 public health officials, but also mentions that some of those names are fake. Why should I trust a man of science who fakes signatures to gain support?  
It also mentions that the declaration was sponsored by a think tank with ties to Charles Koch, who is a well known science denier. So far we're 2 for 2 on not having any reason to believe anything these people say.  
Bhattacharya co-wrote an article about how infections (and therefore herd immunity) were up by as much as 85%, which would have been great if his evidence wasn't really strong evidence, apparently they tested quick fast and in a hurry which lead to false positives that they didn't care about. Birth rates in men can be 100% if I don't care about false positives.  
I don't really have anything on the Martin Kulldorff other than he continued to spread known falsehoods about covid-19, so why should I trust a man who lies about easily verifiable truths?

Coupled with the fact that you couldn't even spell their names right after following them ideologically, I still don't really think that the argument that wearing a mask infringes your personal liberties has any ground to stand on.  
I'll read more into them tomorrow though, maybe this article written by a doctor was wrong (we do have two instances of doctors being wrong in this same post, so who knows maybe we can make it a trifecta).

It is called participatory propaganda. To explain, here are some key excerpts from, ""The Effects of Participatory Propaganda: From Socialization to the Internalization of Conflicts"" (by Gregory Asmolov)


&gt; in online environments, the consumption of propaganda is deeply embedded in the structure of social relations, which allows the propaganda to further infiltrate our everyday lives. more important are the ways social media and the spread of online content create opportunities for immediate action: spreading propaganda further, or taking other actions directly suggested by the propaganda.

&gt;today the digital public sphere offers a new set of tools for the manipulation and control of citizen engagement in conflicts. the socialization of conflict is now driven by the content proliferated through social networks, as well as through the digital affordances of online platforms that offer a range of responses to conflict. the role of content in the socialization of conflicts relies on the distinctive nature of social networking platforms that combine the consumption of news with social interaction, and makes social interaction a mechanism of content proliferation.

&gt;as a result, one may argue that propaganda has become less interested in changing people’s opinion about a specific object or in convincing people that it is either truth or fiction. The main purpose of 21st century propaganda is to increase the scope of participation in relation to the object of propaganda.

&gt;participatory propaganda restores state sovereignty from within. It aims to build walls in the inner spaces of the subject by shaping categories of perception of the environment.

&gt;It is designed to replace networked structures of society with fragmentation and polarization. It helps to pull people apart by forcing them into the role of combatants rather than citizens. It is designed to destroy horizontal relationships that offer alternative sources of information and that can potentially be transformed into independent collective action and a broad opposition to institutional actors. It is designed to divide and rule. It produces a reality with new walls and borders that can sever personal relationships and weaken critical thinking capabilities. Participatory digital propaganda enables the private, everyday identity of users to be occupied and taken over by the institutional actors that propagate it.",-0.9602,21

 Some will handle it better than others. Have sympathy for those who have yet to seek help. Believe it or not, but many people do not want to feel like they have mental issues. They may see mental issues as being a victim and they do not want to be a victim. So they lash out at others if they feel like someone is insinuating that they are.

I'll give you a couple of starting points.

1. Was Covid the only thing that occurred in 2020? If not, is it reasonable to conclude that the spike in mortality rate was solely due to the virus? What else happened in 2020? 
2. Think about the lockdowns. Were they based on scientific research? What evidence constituted that they would help stop the spread? What harm did they bring about? A vast increase of reluctance in the public to visit hospitals for serious conditions that are otherwise treatable, for fear of contracting the virus. A nearly 40% drop in patients treated for severe heart attacks after March 2020 compared to the year before (data in the US). Could that have contributed to the excess deaths last year?",-0.9034,5

I enjoyed shopping more since switching, seeing new products come out is exciting, with masks shopping isn't even fun any more imo.

Cloth masks still impact the environment, water consumption, breakdown time, chemical use in production, microplastics, disposal, and so on.

It's not just strangers, it's the face of anyone you're (allowed) out with, but yeah, isn't it nice to share a smile and start a friendly chat with a stranger? Sure, I've long thought working should be more flexible, but masks are required in far more places than just offices. I mean, in some places you can't even go out for a romantic meal and see your date's face except glimpses between bites...

I'm disabled with nerve damage in my face, and trust me, there are people suffering as a result of mask mandates. Even glasses-wearers have it much harder with them.",0.964,2

Would appreciate a noble rebuttal, because I sense something might come of this discussion:

## Black and White thinking

&gt;By uttering the ""it's not my responsibility to worry about the health of the elderly"" sentiment that the anti-science crowd likes to parrot when they are confronted with a situation requiring them to exercise a modicum of personal responsibility.

This is your black and white thinking, showing two-fold.  OP emphatically did not suggest anything of the sort.  He said:

&gt;If you want to vaccinate, do it. If you want to stay home 24/7, do it. Just don’t force other people to do it as well. That’s where I draw the line and at least I’m doing my part against this authoritarianism.

OP makes a case why we should be careful, thoughtful and on the look out for signs of rampant authoritarianism.  Both present AND future.

This is about freedom &amp; choice, not about absolving personal responsibility.  Those who might be most affected by the virus were/are free to quarantine, lock down, order food from home, avoid meeting their family / friends.

By making it black and white, you are turning the above into an absolutely bad frame to have; that somehow it is irresponsible.  But on that note, here is the fallacy you committed by doing so:

## Irrelevant conclusion, missing the point

&gt;an argument that may in itself be valid, but does not address the issue in question. (Wikipedia

Here is what you said at the end of that sentence:

&gt;confronted with a situation requiring them to exercise a modicum of personal responsibility.

This conversation is not *only* about the responsibility of every single individual to cover their mouths and noses and get vaccinated - for whatever protective reasons purported by the current establishment.  **It is about the personal responsibility of every individual to combat overreaching authoritarian measures** ***incommensurate*** **with the conflict / danger that presents itself.**  What the system wants you to think is that your personal responsibility ends at wearing a mask, and getting vaccinated.  There are people that quite benefit from individuals like you shutting down discourse on any other responsibilities at the moment - **like asking questions about our freedoms.**

## Appeal to authority

&gt;How did I appeal to authority? By throwing my faith behind a body of medical science that defeated diseases like smallpox and polio

Yes, yes indeed, that is *precisely* how someone appeals to authority:  By ""throwing"" his or her faith behind a body of medical science.  With one important addition though: being completely unaware that there is also a body of medical science that offers information contrary, or with more nuance, skepticism, alternate viewpoints / measures to protect ourself, and varying ideas on the unknowns and/or appropriateness of experimenting with novel technology in such a widespread fashion.

So, by omission, you continue peddling only the ""science"" that you perceive as defending your current view, shutting down anything else (putting your head into the sand, as to its existence.)

Those same scientists that ""defeated"" smallpox and polio: are you aware of their positions on these newer mRNA vaccines and its roll-out?  Do you know that everyone one of them would agree with this particular implementation (or maybe even the pandemic associated reactions.)

You **completely** failed to acknowledge the truth of the following statement that u/Lockeylom made:

&gt;There are plenty of doctors against lockdowns, mandatory vaccinations and other restrictions. What we are seeing is the craziest overreaction in decades, and they are using this virus as an excuse to take away the freedom of people and guys like you aren’t even seeing it or care about it.

That is what OP specifically said.  Science has nothing to do with consensus.  Until you openly analyze those professionals, their research, information, skepticism, and various positions on vaccines (from, black, grey to white) you are in the box on this very complicated issue, with even more complicated implications for the future. No, they do not all exist in the form of:

&gt;Netflix, some conspiracy video on Youtube or some widely-panned article on Pubmed

That is your mind *eliminating* the possibility you are wrong before even giving professionals the chance to offer information contrary to your concretely formed evaluation (Im assuming since the beginning)

# Psychologist's fallacy

&gt;an observer presupposes the objectivity of their own perspective when analyzing a behavioral event.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;throw a tantrum

Nobody threw a tantrum.  I hope you didn't behind your keyboard?  You seem to *want* others to perceive those speaking out against authoritarianism as ""throwing a tantrum"".  Just re-read all related posts.  If anything, the anonymous people here have to deal with your lack of awareness about issues far beyond the dangerousness of a virus. I applaud u/Lockeylom and u/Jac0b777 for not throwing a tantrum and presenting reasonable comments &amp; critical thoughts, rather than just virtually shouting or, well, acting somewhat like you.

&gt;The fact that you actively participate in this shit without even a shred of critical thinking shows me that you have fallen for the propaganda and fear mongering.

That is why OP said the above to you btw.  Why do I think he said this?  All you are espousing are the consensus driven narratives, without any care / insight into the issues related to those who might capitalize on or worse, conspire to profit in illegitimate ways on the events that have been unfolding and continue to do so.

## Appeal to motive

&gt;dismissing an idea by questioning the motives of its proposer

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;perpetrate a grift

Uh.  How so?  What products are being sold by OP?  By me? How is he promoting a product or helping to promote a proudct? As a side note, even *if* anyone here is indirectly promoting a product, that does not invalidate the claim.  It just means the information has been somehow monetized (perhaps for a good reason, perhaps for a bad one)

On the other hand, OP / others here seem to be *challenging* a product (a group of products, that will continue development in the future) that is worth possibly hundreds of billions, maybe trillions of dollars (over the long term.)  You know what that product is, right?

Take a moment to inspect your view and you'll see that the cluster of ideas you are appealing to authority to defend is grifting in ways you have yet to imagine / explore.  Not all of them.  Some of them are moved through fear (***however reasonable***).  Through ""best"" practice, or status quo.  Its complicated.  But surely, those at the top of pharmaceutical companies may be heavily motivated by wealth?  Just look at their track record.  You ever do that? (Ex: Pfizer and JJ both somewhat recently settled gigantic civil + criminal lawsuits to the tune of billions of dollars in reparations.  Nothing new there, its been happening for decades.)

## Ad Hominem

&gt;Ad hominem is a fair accusation. You guys are all a bunch of scientifically illiterate, whiny entitled jackasses. I won't even try to deny that one.

At least you skipped the poor attempt to weasel yourself out of this one.  Zero chance you could pull that off.  The fact is, all three of the fallacies I initially accused you of still hold.  Well, what I mean is, I am pretty sure that a trial of unbiased peers would condemn you if they had to compare my case (+ clarification) to your rebuttals.

You're trolling right? In March 2020 there was no new evidence. There were several predictive models that picked and chose the inputs and assumptions they wanted, and predicted something with no correlation in the real world. Prove me wrong.     


Science on asymptomatic transmission:

*Our estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases and their risk of transmission suggest that asymptomatic spread is unlikely to be a major driver of clusters or community transmission of infection, but the extent of transmission risk for pre-symptomatic and minor symptomatic cases remains unknown.* 

https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030


*It’s also unclear to what extent people with no symptoms transmit SARS-CoV-2. The only test for live virus is viral culture. PCR and lateral flow tests do not distinguish live virus. No test of infection or infectiousness is currently available for routine use.678 As things stand, a person who tests positive with any kind of test may or may not have an active infection with live virus, and may or may not be infectious.9*


https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4851

*All close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases tested negative, indicating that the asymptomatic positive cases detected in this study were unlikely to be infectious.*

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w

*We found significantly higher secondary attack rates from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases, although less data were available on the latter. The lack of substantial transmission from observed asymptomatic index cases is notable. However, presymptomatic transmission does occur, with some studies reporting the timing of peak infectiousness at approximately the period of symptom onset*

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102

*No secondary transmission resulted from asymptomatic cases.*

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article

*Among the 91 close contacts of the 9 asymptomatic cases, no secondary transmission was observed*

&gt;The national Dr. Seuss campaign was launched today during a national immunization partnership meeting in Atlanta. At the event, one of the most recognizable Dr. Seuss characters, the Cat in the Hat, unveiled a limited series of six immunization posters featuring Dr. Seuss characters. The art was donated by Mrs. Geisel, through Dr. Seuss Enterprises, Inc., which controls the rights to his works. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will distribute the limited-edition posters to health care providers, medical clinics, community centers, and schools for display.
The six posters each feature a different Dr. Seuss character telling an immunization story in rhyme. Cat in the Hat reminds parents and doctors that “each exam is a chance to bring kids up to date. On routine and catch up, shots that shouldn’t really wait.” An illustration from the King’s Stilts, showing a quarantined child, says, “What’s going on here? What’s wrong with this fella?

* dangerous (has more negatives then positives) for non elderly people (&lt;50) to get vaccinated. **I would love your sources on that :)**
* that sweeden prooves that lax restrictions prove that they are the best solution overall
* that masks requrements should be removed 

.

.

.

So when talking about sweeedn you probably mean their early repsponse ... since after december they do have mask mendates and all that. [source](https://www.thelocal.se/20201218/swedish-prime-minister-stefan-lofven-press-conference-coronavirus/). 

So their restrictions were: 

* isolating elderly, 
* [banning gatherings of more then 50 people](https://www.krisinformation.se/nyheter/2020/mars/ytterligare-begransning-sammankomster), 
* [closing secondary schools](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2020/mars/larosaten-och-gymnasieskolor-uppmanas-nu-att-bedriva-distansundervisning/). 
* recommended everyone to avoid travelling within the country (borders were already closed) which people actually respected and stayed at home. Basically no enforcment was needed. Travel from the Stockholm region had decreased by [80–90%](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/snabbkollen/stockholmare-stannar-hemma-i-pask)


They could rely on a civic responsibility of its citizens to keep the society mostly open. Another thing to mention is that they reacted fast enough. 

So imo the sweeden was in a good position to allow less restiction and still come out fairly good (The death rate is about 4 to 10 times higher than its neighbours). That doesn't prove that the lockdowns don't work. Or that the same restriction could be implemented in other countries without suffering grater losses. Since lockdowns [do seem to work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0) 

The problem imo is just after the shit hit the fan such drastic decisions are needed if we don't want to make the situation even worse. 


&gt; Pfizer's own clinical study shows 0.5% increase in severe adverse reactions which is about ~3x the reduction in severe symptom COVID cases

Can you give me the source on that. 


&gt; encourage to exercise caution

If people actually follow and respect that yes it does work I agree! Like in sweeden it worked really well and it was enough!

&gt; vaccinating everyone

as afar as I am aware it is beneficail for everyone to get vaccine vs getting covid. Covind will in every age group have worse outcomes then getting the vaccine. **Please** prove me wrong.

&gt; Remove masking requirements

why? mask don't really harm you and[ Mandatory mask policies seem to be as effective as policies that have higher costs]( https://nowkalamazoo.com/2020/11/study-mask-mandates-among-the-most-effective-means-of-preventing-covid-deaths/)


&gt; Do NOT fast track vaccine development

Why? Can you prove me that the vaccine is dangerous because of that? Even if it took 3 yers to develop it we still wouldn't know long term effects so that's not an excuse.

 We need vaccine as fast as possible. Is the vaccine any worse because of that? Even if we could in 3 years develop a perfect vaccine it is still better to have a decent vaccine ready as soon as possible.",0.9859,1

It's enough for it to be in the fine print that nobody reads when they get the vaccine and be available to those who look for it. It's not an amount such that a reasonable person would need to take it into account before getting the vaccine. It doesn't establish a good reason not to get the vaccine. The reduction in infections is enough to justify getting it.

I wouldn't really expect that much of a reduction in the mortality rate, either. With breakthrough cases that present severely enough that the patient actually gets a COVID test, we can assume that there is either something wrong with their immune system or with how the vaccine was recieved, leading to a lack of immunity. They would have the same chances as anybody else of surviving.

The only possible reason for locking down is if hospitals are overwhelmed.  That’s it.  There IS no other possible justification.  And guess what?  Hospitals never got overwhelmed, nor will they; from a virus with a 99.98% survival rate for the vast majority of the public.  

Yet we still locked down the entirety of the public and have remained in said lockdown for 15 months.  

 The goal went from a perfectly reasonable 2 weeks to watch the hospitals and make sure they weren’t overcrowding; to suddenly an attempt to have everyone just avoid catching the   thing because it’s scary.  

And This choice was not made by the people; it was forced on everyone or else face punishment by the elites who risked nothing and in fact are profiting off of these lockdowns.  


But the real point is; If some people loses their sense of taste for 5 months because of a virus going around; tough shit.  It was never a solution to hide at home until the common cold went away (which is what a coronavirus is).  

“But what about THIS PERSON I KNOW WHO DIED?” Welcome to planet earth.  There’s sickness.  People die.  Deal with it.  And Guess what?  Everybody dies someday.  Your Fear of risk is no justification to stop others from living.  Nor is hiding from risk a solution to anything; it just prolongs the amount of time everyone suffers.  



And by the way, all of these examples you listed happened in the scenario where we DID lock down.  So I don’t even really see your point in bringing them up.  I can just as easily list my 31 year old roommate who got covid; had the sniffles for 2 days and nothing else.  Or my 74 year old father who just felt a little bit weird for a couple weeks.  

There’s a lot of fake news on excess deaths.  The thing is on face value it logically doesn’t make sense why there would be excess deaths caused by something with the same death rate as a flu that literally just replaced the flu in case numbers.  

So when I see a study from John Hopkins university showing that there aren’t any excess deaths; I’m gonna trust that any day over CNN (which has been caught calling suicides “covid deaths”) .

I'd start with a review of Sweden's experience which I summarize [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/j5xn5w/trump_health_official_meets_with_doctors_pushing/g7w8bwv/).  Frankly, it seems to me a fairly trivial observation to recognize that lockdowns, even if they do provide *some* marginal benefit in the form of reduced COVID deaths, clearly can't justify their *staggering* costs.  

From a post titled: [""What's the Value of a QALY?""](https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/06/whats-value-of-qaly.html)

&gt;**Typical value benchmarks in the United States have historically ranged from approximately $50 000 to, more recently, as high as approximately $150 000 per QALY.** Those benchmarks purport to represent the “value” of a QALY; ie, the “willingness to pay” to gain 1 QALY of health. The benchmark could also be conceived as a measure of opportunity cost in terms of the health outcomes of the marginal intervention that must be relinquished to provide resources for a new intervention. Interventions with lower cost-effectiveness ratios below the benchmark are said to have favorable value because they “buy” QALYs relatively inexpensively; ie, at a cost below the value indicated by the benchmark. Interventions with higher ratios “buy” QALYs expensively and hence have unfavorable value. The United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which is charged with assessing health technology value for that country’s National Health Service, has used more stringent benchmarks. With a number of exceptions, **favorable value has generally corresponded to cost-effectiveness ratios below £20 000 (about $28 000) per QALY, and unfavorable value has generally corresponded to ratios exceeding £30 000 (about $42 000) per QALY.**

Assume that the US would have seen an additional 500,000 COVID-19 deaths without lockdowns (an *absurdly* high and unrealistic estimate for which there's zero evidence), and further assume that each of those 500,000 ""saved"" lives will get to enjoy, on average, an additional 10 quality-adjusted life years (another estimate that is absurdly high given the age and health status of most COVID-19 deaths).  

Finally, if we use the very high end estimate of $150,000 / QALY, all of those absurdly pro-lockdown estimates together imply that US lockdowns provided a $750 billion benefit.  But their *costs* have clearly been in the *trillions*. 

Let's do another estimate with numbers that I think are still quite generous but at least in the realm of potentially plausible.  If we assume that lockdowns resulted in 75,000 fewer US deaths, each of those on average getting to enjoy an additional 5 quality-adjusted life years, and we use $100,000 as the ""value"" (i.e., opportunity cost proxy) for a QALY, that would give us a benefit of $37.5 billion.  The combined costs of our response are obviously *so* much greater than that it's not even funny!",0.9939,3

I've been laid off since mid October (a regular planned layoff, not because of ""covid""). I only got the regular amount of unemployment, nothing extra. But I was really, really, really hoping all this BS would be over by the time I went back to work. So no more wearing masks, etc, but out of luck.   
I was called for the meeting because I'm going back to work Monday and I'm sensitive to bleach which they use for cleaning. Before the layoff, they were cleaning only once per week and I had to come in early on one day so I could get my 8 hours and leave before they cleaned. Now they're cleaning EVERY day, so something had to be figured out concerning my schedule. Of course, it's for me to come in early every day.   
I'm NOT a morning person! It has always been difficult for me to get up early, except Saturday mornings for cartoons (lucky to be in that generation of prime kid entertainment lol). \*sigh\* As of now, I have to be at work at 7 am instead of 8 am.   
The only possible plus is if the (guessing) H2O2 based spray gives me a headache like the bleach does. In which case, I may get to come in at 8, and end up working only 35 instead of 40 hours per week. Which is fine with me, not so much less money that I won't be able to pay my bills.   
But my main point of posting all this was that during the meeting, I sooooo wanted to share the facts I've been educated with that go against what my supervisors and HR were claiming about ""the danger"", etc. of ""covid"". But I couldn't, it would have probably just created a tense situation. And my factual information ignored, even if I had gone prepared with video links, documents, etc. I didn't even know what the meeting was going to be about, so I couldn't plan to take factual docs even if I wanted. Before the meeting started, I was in the room with one of my supervisors and said ""I'm nervous"" and he said ""why?"". I said, ""is it something bad?"" And he said ""no."" Still didn't find out purpose until everyone had joined us. Of course, we were all wearing masks and social distanced....UGH!  
So my coworkers and I have to wear masks which don't stop viruses but do potentially harm us when we're away from desk (not as bad as 100% of time, if that were the case, I'd probably have to try getting an exemption or resigning), H2O2 (?) based spray used throughout the building twice each day (morning and afternoon), one employee goes through and I guess wipes down all desks, etc, and bleach used to clean the restrooms daily.   
It's all so ridiculous. One other coworker is with me on this, that I know of, but she can't really do anything either. Two employees isn't enough to make change, sadly.   
If this is really the Age of Aquarius, truth is supposed to be part of it.....ok, very ready for it to show its face!",0.7848,6

Bad enough we pulled our kids out of school and my wife homeschools them. My wife who has a bachelors in biology and masters in operatic performing arts, so please don't imagine the TV-programmed imagery of the religious weirdos with their weirdo homeschooled kids. :-)

So yeah... It's just obvious. A deliberate dumbing down of our entire society. The more I think about it, the more it seems like a deliberate build up to what may be happening now. 

In 1975 Kissinger wrote Security Memorandum Study 200 which was declassified in 1989. It's all about the World Population Plan of Action. From what I can tell, that's when this stuff really began to pick up (although its rooted in the eugenics movement -- people forget that before WWII, USA was the eugenics capital of the world. It fell out of fashion after the horrors of what happened in Germany, but the families that took so much interest in eugenics raised children who raised children that rule the world today.

THIS is a big part of what made me start questioning things in the first place.

Around August 2020, case count was steadily rising in BC after it was crushed during first round of restrictions. I was one of the few people (on the local subreddit) saying the province should clamp down on it before it got out of control and we had worse restrictions.

Which of course is what happened.

What really bothered me was, if there's a deadly virus spreading in the community, wasn't it negligent and criminal of public health to basically ignore it until October/November?

I will never understand that. Did they hope it would just disappear? Did they want it to get bad enough that the citizens would go along with prolonged restrictions (with the idea that only that level of restriction would be effective)? Was it a best of intentions thing but with too soft of an approach? Did they hope the recommendations in place plus contact tracing would actually work, when week-after-week case numbers were creeping up? I don't get it.",-0.5509,3

That's like me saying the number of people who die from cancer is significally greater among cancer patients than healthy people.  Well, duh... OBVIOUSLY you have to have a disease to die from it.

And just fyi, that number is 2-4% (at least the last time I checked).  The number of Covid patients who die from covid is 2-4%.

Here's a [link](https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid), updated 5 hours ago... lots of various data, comparing various countries and first few weeks of pandemic with death rate was high amongst covid patients, especially in Wuhan, but seems to be 2% death rate currently.

And not sure what you are saying about comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated.  Obviously, the death rate of vaccinated covid patients is going to be lower than non-vaccinated covid patients.  That is the reason the vaccine was passed... it lessens the severity and death rate for covid patients when the the catch it.  It has never been proven to prevent covid (it has an effective rate of 80% or 91% depending on the vaccine), it reduces the severity of covid when you catch it.

My breathing was FINE, I had no cough, no issue, nothing. Sense of taste and smell were okay. My issue was a sore throat and a fever. I thought i had tonsillitis or bad strep and sat with it for almost a week before it hurt so bad I was convinced they would remove my tonsils; I could see pus and pockets in my thoat in my tonsils and my sister had bad tonsil issues growing up so I thought it was certainly tonsillitis. 

My boyfriend who lives with me got sick, but he wasn't NEARLY as sick. His symptoms were a low grade fever and the loss of taste and smell but his came back when he got better and he was able to taste some things (he said he could taste green chili) anyway. He got sick like a week after I did. We also have a roommate and he was fine. 

I went to the Dr and they gave me that covid, flu, etc combo test and I came back covid positive 15 mins later. 

My boyfriends took 3 days to come back positive but I don't think he got the same test. 

None of it made any sense to me the entire time. At one point my body had swelled up, my hands and feet and then my neck was so stiff and so swollen I looked like George Corpsegrinder (Google pics if you don't know who I'm talking about). My PCP sent me to the ER 3 days after my test, convinced something else was up, because my neck was stupid swollen I don't even know how to describe it, and they laughed at me and told me ""it's just covid"" then gave me a steroid shot in my arm that actually helped the swelling go down. 

I haven't met anyone else that had the same symptoms so I kinda think there's a chance they just blamed covid for whatever was going on. Kinda like those death numbers :/",0.2787,2

I've worked in healthcare myself, I have friends in healthcare. One thing, potentially worth bearing in mind - is that you tend to see the worst of it, those admitted to ER etc.. because of your field.

So I can dig out articles showing the opposite of your study. There is no point, we are simply not going to agree. The point I am making is that there is plenty of information to the counter, whatever side you are on. There are countries that have banned using the PCR test to influencing policy due to its very high false positive rate.

So you have a lot of assumptions, which is not unusual in these discussions. I have also had it, pretty bad for a week, I'm fairly sure part of the reason it was so bad was due to my level of stress at the time, but I've recovered ok.

To be generous with the risk factor, we could say there is a 1/1000 chance of dying from it/having long term complications. Even IF the risk was as high as you believe, there is no way that justifies the measures taken against the virus in my eyes, not for a moment.

Here in the UK, if you are 40- and relatively healthy, you have a greater statistical risk of drowning.

I applaud your care and concern for other people, one that we share. However my concern also extends towards people killing themselves, mothers giving birth alone, old folks dying alone, increases in mental health problems, non-diagnosed and lack of treatment for cancer/heart conditions etc..., I am also concerned of the break down of society, mistrust in our fellow humans, the world our children are growing up in, crippling levels of debt, an increasingly brainwashed and manipulated populace, the loss of essential freedoms which are in place to make life worth living... and so, so much more.

Simply put, the measures must be proportionate and sensible, in consideration of the risk and ramifications of such measures. The cure cannot be worse than the disease - which it IS, unquestionably and very much so - in my opinion.

I have always been in favour of targeted protection for vulnerable groups. I have always been against the steady slide into medical/authoritarian tyranny - which this virus is unquestionably being used as the vehicle for (if one is paying attention).

It is not that I am ignoring it, or that I do not know someone who has died or suffered long term effects, it is more that I also consider other factors, and balance those, on a short-medium-long term effects also.

Where we are heading is terrifying, infinitely worse than the virus itself.

I would also offer a danger, for those whose career and purpose is wrapped up in ""combating this virus"", I can relate, I've had my own version of it in my life - and also experienced the pain of the narratives I was identified with come crashing down once I came to see the wood for the trees, and the way my *desire to do good* had made me less questioning and more easily railroaded into certain actions and beliefs.

For what it is worth, there is nothing in life that I would wish to be wrong on more than this, however, unfortunately - everything in me, all that I have learnt in this life, all that I observe - is indicating that my position is close to the mark.

All the best",-0.9559,10

To become a scientist, you have to go through many years of studies seeing things in depth, doing a lot of analysis, criticizing your own research and the research of others and being ready to defend your research and explain why you did things the way you did them while others criticize it.

Even when I was somewhat of a doomer and believed that Corona was pretty dangerous, I was thinking that unless they go full force into welding people into their homes, the virus can't be contained. Lockdowns mean nothing. I thought ""lockdowns"" were a joke in the very beginning. We're told to wear masks, but many people wearing a mask aren't even wearing the special medical ones that doctors wear. And we're told to stay at home, but the supermarkets are still open and you can freely go into them.

This shit was doomed to fail, and the sad part is that the media blames your fellow men for the failure. No, it didn't fail because old Bob didn't comply with wearing masks. It didn't fail because David wanted to hang out with his friends. It failed because it was super flawed and the fact that people don't see this is just a testament as to why we're in this dumpster fire in the first place.

To my knowledge, there is no provision in the Coronavirus Act 2020 that gives the Government this power. Saying that, I haven't read all of it because it's paaaaages long!

The Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, Section 45F, Paragraph (5)(a) (I think, this is from memory so I might be a bit out) states explicitly that people cannot be imprisoned for breaching regulations made under the Act. But then again, the same Act also places a maximum fine of £5100 for breaching health regulations, but that has been disregarded with the £10000 fines for large gatherings, so it wouldn't surprise me if they just enact the regs under the Public Health Act despite it explicitly restricting them doing it in that regard.

The Government could use the Civil Contingencies Act, which pretty much allows it to enact regulations which have the same power as Acts of Parliament, in an emergency. They haven't used this Act so far, so we'll have to see what they do.

We'll just have to wait and see. Whatever they do will be absolutely disgusting, and will be the usual infringements on Human Rights.",-0.7455,7

The people who implement these murderous mandates aren't interested in a conversation about it. Comply or die. These letters are non-compliance and a perfect excuse to cut someone loose. Use at your own risk.

Sure, that's a possibility.

But, at the same time, I don't think very many of these places have thought through the legal ramifications of requiring vaccines, even approved ones.  All it's going to take is 1 or 2 high profile cases where an employer requires a COVID vaccine as a term for employment, especially where there is little business justification and then the employee is disabled for life or dies.  To me, the biggest positive of these forms is to point this out.

&gt; On legality - Everything is legal until a court says it's not. So far, the only court case we have on this went the wrong way, in Texas with the nurses.

I don't agree with the specific ruling, because the vaccine in question is still under EUA, but I can understand why front line healthcare workers *might* be required to have up to date immunizations under more normal circumstances.",0.0788,1

They don't need to because you can go to the store by yourself to get food that's healthy for you.

[""The calculated vaccine efficacy was 80%-90% against paralytic polio and 60%-70% against all types of polio.""](https://www.who.int/immunization/polio_grad_ipv_effectiveness.pdf) vs [""BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19""](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33301246/)

No vaccine in all of history (or immune response in general) is literally 100% effective at preventing disease. That is simply not how vaccines work. They dramatically reduce the chance of infection, and the severity of infection if it does take hold, just like your immune system does after being exposed to a disease.

Although these particular ones actually do happen to be so effective at preventing death from covid that we haven't been able to measure deaths from covid after vaccination, so we actually don't know how many nines go at the end of their efficacy for that metric. They essentially round to 100% effective at preventing deaths, although in reality they're probably somewhere in the ballpark of 99.99% to 99.9999% effective two weeks after second dose.",0.9752,-2

Since when isn't a job the same as a government. People you've never met telling you how to accomplish their goals. The similarities are staggering.

However, I think we have a difference of opinion on the levels of the term ""violence"" and ""force"".

That being said, both our opinions are completely valid.

""Do this or get fired""

I consider the above ""violent"" and coercion. You can choose to not follow their directive, but if you do you might be in a world of trouble afterwards.

That, in my opinion, is a definition of force. I totally understand it is not yours.

As I said before, both our opinions are valid. It is a question of degrees. And not everyone is as ""strong"" or ""hard"" as others, so they will fold much easier than another person.

Here's a tip - if you really, truly want to make sure you have the truth on your side, as opposed to doling out gotchas and chasing wins, you have to make a good faith effort to actually understand the arguments of the other side - to the point where you could describe in your own words what their position is from their point of view and have them agree with your representation. 

Realize that the disdain you have for the other side, and the strength in your belief that you have the correct version of reality - they have that too. That should tell you that feeling of superiority that swells your chest - it means nothing. If both parties feel the same thing, they can't both be right. That feeling is deceptive. You can't trust it. 

Check in with yourself from time to time - are you striving to understand the truth about the world, regardless of whether or not it confirms your pre-existing biases, or are you just trying to get a ""win""? 

It's the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it. Are you strong enough to weather the discomfort of wondering whether you might actually be wrong about something, or whether the other side may actually have a point?

Best of luck in your intellectual endeavors.

Like many I first thought it was the latests swine flu, something that gets hyped in the media but doesn’t affect many people. Then the news came in from the virus hitting New York and most people stopped going out. I went to a bar and another day a restaurant and I was one of the only people there. Then a couple weeks later there was an actual lockdown in my state (PA). At this point I reconsidered whether this was something to be taken seriously. I looked at the data from New York and noticed the deaths were mostly older people. I then had to question why I was being put in lockdown for something that isn’t a big threat to me (I’m in my 20’s). 

For better or for worse my first instinct when someone tries to impose rules on me is to do the opposite. I also reached the conclusion this was a case of the economic fallacy of “the seen and the unseen” (the seen cost of covid deaths is obvious to everyone but the unseen costs of lockdown are not obvious) and the fallacy of “the fatal conceit” (the false belief a bureaucrat can have the knowledge to make choices for large numbers of people).

I would say it’s much more dangerous for the government to keep the gun owning, rebellious population around then it is the other way.

Say people with vaccines start dying/getting sick in 6 months to a year. The only healthy people left are going to be the anti Covid-19 vaccine people. 

Population drop achieved. But now the people who wanted the population to decreases have to face the angry population. No way we let them remain in power after we watch vaccinated people drop like flies. (Although at this point I wouldn’t mind seeing a few people who took the shot drop dead). 

I have no idea what the play is. Maybe it’s a fertility drop. So big medicine can make more money off of rich people trying to have babies while also lowering the worlds population. 

Maybe it’s a targeted vaccine that only attacks certain people with genetic traits. Remember 23 and me and how hard that was pushed a few years ago!?",-0.9746,5

*Nevertheless, apart from Mises and his readers, practically no one thinks of Nazi Germany as a socialist state. It is far more common to believe that it represented a form of capitalism, which is what the Communists and all other Marxists have claimed.*

*The basis of the claim that Nazi Germany was capitalist was the fact that most industries in Nazi Germany appeared to be left in private hands.*

*What Mises identified was that private ownership of the means of production existed in name only under the Nazis and that the actual substance of ownership of the means of production resided in the German government.* ***For it was the German government and not the nominal private owners that exercised all of the substantive powers of ownership: it, not the nominal private owners, decided what was to be produced, in what quantity, by what methods, and to whom it was to be distributed, as well as what prices would be charged and what wages would be paid, and what dividends or other income the nominal private owners would be permitted to receive. The position of the alleged private owners, Mises showed, was reduced essentially to that of government pensioners.***

Not to mention **the book your lefty beta Hitler wrote** where he weeps like a lefty dictator beta, on and on, about how he's **a radical left wing socialist**, not to mention the **infinite socialist policies**, **infinite socialist speeches**, etc, etc, etc.

Lol, it's even in the name: National German **Socialist.**

In **Mein Kampf**, Hitler even describes (on and on), about what it means to be a beta bitch national **socialist**, and how it's infinitely left wing.

I assume you are referring to the government and not the person himself, because I highly doubt he is involved in the covid administrative matters. 

The frustration regarding lockdown is understandable. Lockdowns come at a high economic and social cost. The aim is to reduce the number of infected, which is a compounding number, thus the earlier and stricter, the better. However, governments often only focus on the latter aspect, and even so impose shitty lockdowns that are not much worse from having no lockdowns at all.(compounding effect). Thus, you should not blame lockdown itself , but rather the scope and effectiveness of it. A strict and efficient lockdown which will quickly reduce cases can be done in less than two weeks to a month, along with lots of contact tracing. Certainty, tangible losses must be taken into account. A trade off must be established, such that a good balance can be struck in between the two. (HK is a good example of this, the infection waves correspond to each time guard of covid is let down). IMO, contact tracing and quarantine is the most effective and least damaging way(in fact, you can prevent spikes just by doing this) , but lockdowns should and must be implemented when the need arises.",0.8869,-3

Now I now this might sound immature but its the best way I can explain it:

Lets presume in this scenario whoever is peeing has corona/COVID-19

If both of the people have no pants on, then the one peeing will get the other wet

If the one that isnt peeing is the only one wearing pants, then he still gets wet

If the one that is peeing is the only one wearing pants then there is little to now chance that the other one will get wet

And in the best case scenario they both have pants on so only the one peeing gets wet

The point of a mask is not to protect yourself, but others, and those others can protect you

This whole thing is psychological: if we get demoralized, they win. Put the emotional energy into resistance instead.

Most people need *at least* 7.5 hours, sometimes more if they exercise a good deal. Some pro athletes can sleep up to 10-12 hours because they require so much recovery from their intense training. They may or may not sleep that all in one go or break it up into smaller pieces.

In sleep studies where they take away all artificial light and people have to live by the light of the sun alone like our ancestors did, people fall asleep with the sun, they wake up for a couple hours in the middle of the night, and then go back to sleep again until the sun rises. The average would still be around 8 hours for a normal person, but more hours if they were doing exhausting work during the day.

The waking up in the middle of the night for just a couple hours is called biphasic sleep and commonly referenced in literature written before the invention of electricity. They would refer to it as ""1st sleep"" and ""2nd sleep"". There's also some cultures that have that afternoon siesta nap in places where the heat was too intense to continue working.

In other words, before electricity and unlimited caffeine, people got A LOT of sleep.

I challenge you to give your body as much sleep as it asks for, instead of the bare minimum you're able to get away with. You may be surprised by how amazing you feel after just a few days of doing that.",0.7509,1

And enough of this sob story BS.

Also, if this person is using governmental programs to stay on their feet along with the job, they don't even need to pay for higher education! For example, JobCorps. JobCorps is commonly unknown free trade school for troubled youth and low income individuals that offers many, *many* different trades, and can help you obtain a GED if you dropped out of high school at some point and a driver's license if you don't already have one.

All the farmers in America that use modern John Deere tractors have been struggling with them because when something minor happens to them, it can be very expensive to fix, plus the computer that manages the tractor’s electrical components may lock out the tractor until it is taken to a certified dealer to be reset. This is why John Deere has been the focus of the right to repair movement, because farmers want tractors similar to their older ones where everything could be repaired themselves. But John Deere is not to blame, it is the EPA. The massive amounts of emissions regulation that was enacted throughout the later 2000s led to diesel manufacturers having no choice but to install all these expensive filters that if not maintained properly will break and cost loads of money to fix. This is why the tractors get locked out by the computer, John Deere thought most people would rather bring their tractor to the dealer to get a small fix instead of letting them use it more until it really gets fucked up and ends up costing them tens of thousands of dollars. None of this would be the case if they didn’t need all the emissions filters. And to those of you who think companies like it this way, search up the Volvo emissions scandal, or the Volkswagen tdi clean diesel scandal, engine manufacturers have been trying to get around the regulations since they were put in place.",-0.9055,3

I wonder how many of the other 26% had had one jab. I don't take Vanden Bossche seriously, but looking at this it might be possible that the virus is using that ramp of partial immunity in the partially vaccinated to mutate to be more resistant to the immunity acquired by vaccination. Or maybe it's just a coincidence that happened in Massachusetts.

This also protects anyone who has a legitimate reason why they can't wear a mask, or whose mask slips, or who takes their mask off to eat, or who carries that infectious material into their homes where they then go about unmasked.

You're still missing the point I'm trying to make: wearing a mask is not only to protect yourself from everyone else, but also to protect everyone else from yourself if you happen to be infected without knowing it. It's not ""worrying about everyone around you being a vector"", it's worrying about *you* being a vector and everyone around you being potentially vulnerable. Saying ""there's no point in me wearing a mask because the virus won't hurt me"" is to say that you only care about the virus' effects on yourself - that the wellbeing, the safety, and potentially the *lives* of those around you are less important to you than your own personal inconvenience of having to wear a mask.",0.8589,0

&gt;You are right to question whether free and informed consent is at all possible under present circumstances. Long-term effects are unknown. Transgenerational effects are unknown. Vaccine-induced deregulation of natural immunity is unknown. Potential harm is unknown as the adverse event reporting is delayed, incomplete and inconsistent between jurisdictions.

You are being told that you are now the problem and that the world cannot get back to normal unless you get vaccinated. You are being viciously scapegoated by propaganda and pressured by others around you. Remember; there is nothing wrong with you.  
&gt;  
&gt;You are inaccurately accused of being a factory for new SARS-CoV-2 variants, when in fact, according to leading scientists, your natural immune system generates immunity to multiple components of the virus.

Yes, the blocking faces aspect is one of the ways I had in mind. I also consider that if you're rationally trying to keep from infecting people so you wear a mask, you really shouldn't open your mouth and say anything to people at all -- after all you will spread a lot more droplets talking through a mask than you will keeping your mouth shut without one. That plus it creates a general sense that the people around you are hazards to your health and you are a hazard to their health. Doesn't seem healthy to me.

I disagree with ""If everyone wore the same kind of properly fitted mask, and followed hygiene protocols, the science suggests there would be fewer infections."", I don't think the science is anywhere close to suggesting that; and on the flip side of that argument, I don't think science has settled whether wearing an improperly fitted mask and/or not following hygiene protocols might not be making things worse than just not wearing a mask at all. Which is not to say I firmly believe one of those things. I think it's way too early to tell. I find the instant consensus of the world's health experts fishy -- science does not usually progress from zero to consensus in that brief a period of time.

The point about /r/maskskepticism is that the banning of a sub for dubious reasons is evidence of agenda-pushing. They also banned /r/truemaskskepticism at the exact same time, for the same reason, ""being used for violence."" Clearly it's about masks and not about violence. Regarding whether it's a ""shadow organization"" behind it, it's not like I think the Trilateral Commision rang up the administration and told them to pull the plug. But I find it very possible that some public health organization sent out some kind of memo saying that sites need to crack down on misinformation.",-0.6935,1

Here are the numbers for Quebec as of August 12:

Source:

https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec/

In a Province with a population of over 8 million, they have had one single COVID death per day for the past three days in a row. Total deaths over the last seven days were 9.

Admittedly it was rough a few months ago. So far they have had 5,709 deaths. But the mask mandate is only three weeks old and the numbers are way down.

Now let’s look at those deaths for a second, which, by the way, 59.79% were in one region (Montreal); and assuming that they have been properly coded as COVID deaths (I know, big assumption here but bear with me):

91.6% (that’s not a typo) of deaths were people over 70 years old and the majority were in assisted living facilities.

Heck, 73.7% were over the age of 80. It might help to know that life expectancy in Quebec is 80.6 years for men and 84.5 years for women. So, is there a chance that some of these were people on their deathbeds and just happened to catch C-19 before dying? I don’t know. But with these numbers, the way the deaths are distributed over the age groups, the very low current mortality figures, I cannot comprehend how anyone would think a universal mask mandate for EVERYONE is justifiable. 

""The commission did state that the decree enforced by the government should be removed or modified as soon as it is no longer justified by the circumstances.""

Income tax promotes investments and growth. Sales tax is a scam as well as pretty much every other tax since your money are already taxed once, except import tax needed to balance international vs domestic goods trade. The whole point behind tax is to stop money accumulation and force you to invest otherwise you get taxed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Value is determined by the mechanisms of supply and demand.

If that was the case you wouldn't have an R&amp;D concept. So this is nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If sandcastles are made by labor then why don’t they have value?

Nobody dictates how to use labor. What to produce and who to target as the consumer it's up to you. The loop is idea -&gt; r&amp;d -&gt; production -&gt; consumption -&gt; feed back another idea from the outcome. With every segment of the market you can spin it up (you can also ruin it). The faster this loop operates the faster the progress. Not only a consumer can create the demand. A producer can also create demand by exploiting certain aspects in human beings. That's what a famous painter does in this example by exploiting human senses. Don't you get it? He used himself as the R&amp;D part. It was planned he didn't just draw a couple of lines with 2-3 colors. And with the vintage wine, he can exploit your imagination from an era you never experienced. He makes you want that unique item.

So when you say

&gt;I can spend hours and hours on a painting

it gives you experience not only some isolated output at the moment, but experience how to create demand with what you know. So building sandcastles has value in that sense",0.6016,1

They deny you your 2nd amendment rights by making it unbelievably difficult to purchase firearms of any type (shotguns, pistols) leaving you completely at the mercy of police response time. 

I could NEVER move back into that environment. The decade I lived in NY state (Rockland, Orange, Dutchess, etc) after moving out of the Bronx, I and the exwife owned shotguns. And it was fairly simple to acquire once you passed the FBI criminal background test. 

And we bought several shotguns/shells for both shooting and home defense. 

We didnt want handguns because we had a young child so I cant comment on what it takes to purchase one. 

Point is we never felt it (firearms for home defense)  was inaccessible and all our neighbors were armed home owners. 

This is another reason I laughed when some mob protesters threatened to bring heat to the outlying suburbs in one interview.

I chuckled ""you mofos dont know nothing about the burbs ... you are confusing tv and movies with reality"" 

Folks in the suburbs will respect your 1st amendment right to PEACEFULLY protest.

USA numbers show a bit higher number but it is not an extreme outlier. 350k deaths are reported as covid, which were probably highly inflated. They listed deaths as covid deaths even if you had a heart attack, but had a covid virus. So go figure which one killed you more likely.

Even without covid cases, the year 2020 would be visibly higher in deaths. Sure I do agree with you that covid did increase the mortality for certain individuals. But in reality these individuals would  pass away anytime from a flu, maybe this year or next one. 
 
Anyway, just realized that  these numbers start to look a bit altered on the official websites. I looked at them few months (April) ago and they did not look so different from previous years as they are now.",0.4497,2

If it were, I would have no issue with fucking off. The problem is that unlike the weather from my last example, this is a virus. Viruses can spread through any number of means. When people get a virus they get sick. When people get sick with a virus that has a high enough mortality rate they die. 

So the question for the government, which is tasked with protecting it's people, becomes not ""what will you do to stay out of our goddamned business"" but ""what will you do to keep your people safe"" (or at least, I would hope that's the question they ask themselves but let's be real, govt., No matter which side of the spectrum they are from, doesn't give a fuck about us average everyday people). With an illness, the best thing you can do is prevent it from spreading. The only difference between covid and any other virus is that covid has a higher chance of killing people and spreads SIGNIFICANTLY easier. 

And you know, I'm with you on the government interfering in our lives. I don't want it. I want to be left the fuck alone like most people. The severity of this as a worldwide crisis is why they need to because of how rampantly this could spread and get out of hand if additional judicial measures weren't implemented. 

That being said, I too, hope for a day where we don't have this new normal of wearing masks, socially distancing, minimum capacity sporting events. The list goes on. I miss it too. But we have to look out for our fellow man and take care of each other the best way we can. Unfortunately for y'all, that would be by requiring you to, at least for the time being, wear a mask to prevent the spread and close certain areas down that.

It's impossible to disprove OR prove, using the scientific method, the existence of god(s) and religion.

This is YOUR claim:

Science is able to undeniably determine the NON-existence of God(s) and religions.

The burden of proof is on YOU, as an advocate of science. It's YOUR job to create a case that science disproves religion / god(s), WHICH YOU STILL HAVEN'T DONE, after I've asked multiple times!

You're making a wild assumption that's not grounded in logic or scientific thinking, which can be summed up as follows:

With the growing knowledge we have of the natural world, we believe the world could have existed without supernatural forces, so obviously no supernatural force must exist. 

This is a false cause fallacy, you're proposing two premises and claiming that these two premises are casually linked. This is not intellectually honest.

At this point in the conversation, I think it's obvious that you have this pseudo-religious belief in the lack of the existence of gods and claiming science to prop up this pseudo religious belief, when in reality you aren't using good scientific reasoning and logic.

I'll repeat myself again:

The most SCIENTIFIC claim you can have about the existence of god(s) is that there isn't enough data to determine the existence or lack of existence of god(s) and there has not been any real scientific experiment that has been proposed to definitively prove otherwise.",-0.8561,1

He left not long after, put in jail for a drug offense, which frankly saved his life.

I've long since come to terms with what he was and with what I nearly did, and I absolutely do not think he will ever change. I'd never give him another chance, nor would my mother. Yet I can still empathize with him, because I know how he became what he became. I still consider him a human being. I still want him to have rights. Well, I would if he were still alive, he overdosed some years later.

In other words, you don't know shit about me and my views on abuse. I daresay I have an extremely clear understanding of how difficult it is for an abuser to change.

That is the major problem. Comparing apples to oranges in data is called manipulation.  


*&gt;decent educated guess of deaths caused by the flu.*  
There is no consensus on this in literature, AT ALL. Educated guess my ass.

*&gt;Also just because the actual flu virus didn't kill you doesn't mean it's not a flu related death which is what they are actually counting. That other bacterial infection*   
*wouldn't have killed the person if they didn't also have the flu.*  
Agreed, which is also why a lot of the Covid deaths misrepresent the severity of the disease. This knife cuts both ways.  


*&gt;They are sent there because they are very sick.*  
Which normally didn't happen at this scale. A lot of people died at home.

*&gt;your 85 you could still have 10 to 15 more years of good life.*  
Agreed, but I try to be objective and deal with statistics. If the average age of the diseased (without life threatening co-morbidities) is at or above the average life expectancy I would count these as natural deaths, as most hospitals have for a very long time.  


These deaths do not decrease the metric, which is rather significant. How can you claim there is a life threatening disease so deadly that we have to stop the entire world for it, if it does not decrease the ALE significantly?  


*&gt;There are only two main types of influenza that cause infections in humans.*  
Where do you get these ideas? There are many. There are two types that overrule most others. it's an evolutionary Pareto distribution. (Power law)  


*&gt;The following sources show that these claims are wrong.*

I read that Pachetti article when it was published. The math is wrong, the comparisons are bogus and my god those correlations they draw to be causal. It makes me puke. I've written an article (not in English) half a year ago what is so bad about it. The article was about as long as the paper. At that point I still had the hope that I was severely wrong. But this propaganda is the best you guys have. if it wasn't for major censorship of qualified scientists there would not have been a discussion at all, this would have been regarded as rubbish.

It used to be super harsh with the covid passports aka ""the israeli green pass"" but people just kinda threw it down the drain and now while technically you are still required to be vaccinated at all time, it's now forbidden to force someone to prove it. You can just say ""yes I have been vaxxed"" and it's fine. 

It was very gloom for me mid way the covid installment my department tried to force me to vaccinate (I was a rookie police officer) but I was too stubborn and vigorously turned them down with a firm hand. He refused to fire me but also refused to pay me so I was stuck home untl I submitted. I didn't submit and finally managed to find the courage to leave this abusive relationship and have since found a new job as a carpenter in a local demolition team and I am getting paid well. 

It all passes, you just gotta go through the grit and fight with your heart all the way. 

The government is coming for round two here, and threatened us that ""because of delta variant"" people will have to vaccinate again and wear masks and show proof of vaccines lockdowns and all that shit, but no one is betting an eye, we can all see the bullshit in their eyes, you don't even gotta say ""no"" it's enough to ignore and not comply. The corpos no longer comply with the government thus they dont follow covid law because they understand the money of the people is better than the money of the government, local shops and businesses are no longer scared of the government, and the people are tired and stubborn. It is true many ""gave up"" and took the vaccine here, but it was more of a trade deal. They took the vaccine and in their eyes, it seals the deal for a return to normal, and no government trickery will convince them otherwise.

When the people finally find common ground and are no longer divided they can and will control the big bad wolves in suits.",-0.9932,124

That way they can sell them to government and healthcare entities and even private businesses to test their employees. They can continuously test (""You might be able to get the virus a second time after recovering, so get tested frequently to make sure!"") so they'll always be able to keep selling the same product to the same customers for as long as the customer thinks there is a threat that needs to be addressed. 

Like any other market this will only stop when the demand for the tests dries up but their CEO and other medical company executives in combination with the media (just lookup how much pharmaceutical and medical companies spend on advertising on these news networks every year) are now out there trying to artificially create and increase demand for the tests. My advice to anyone out there is don't get these tests unless you are actually sick or think you've been exposed to someone who is sick. Otherwise you're helping to prolong  a really sinister corporate marketing scheme. The ideal situation for this company and others like it is to make every household buy a months pack of Corona tests or something similar to how the average household buys toilet paper.

This isn't even addressing the messed up contact tracing app that Abbot is tying into these tests. Their app Navica tracks test results and gives everyone a ""Digital Health Pass"" with a barcode and expiration date. Here's directly from the product copy from the Navica website: Navica ""allows people who test negative to get an encrypted temporary digital  NAVICA Pass, similar to an airline boarding pass. NAVICA-enabled  organizations will be able to verify an individual's negative COVID-19  test results by scanning the individual's digital NAVICA Pass to  facilitate entry into facilities.""",-0.96,2

And you know what? Honestly, the curve never once looked ""flattened"".... still has the same curve as any other disease, all of this theatre, suspension of rights, etc, has been all for nothing. 

&gt;One of the points I see here quite a lot is that young people aren’t dying so why should they get the vaccine? Well let’s imagine we let everyone free to do what they want without a vaccine, they’re going to again, skyrocket the cases, because they’ll still be heavily symptomatic. This will put strain on the hospitals again, and because of this, young(er) people will start dying, a long with a bunch of older people (like in India again).

Your supposing here that natural recovery doesn't leave people with natural immunity - in fact - even my doctor agreed with me that the more that we vaccinate explicitly in the way that we are with vaccines targeting only the S1,S2, and RBM (spike protein) we are putting evolutionary pressure on the virus to mutate - vs. older vaccines that let each body do their thing on a virus ""training dummy"" 

&gt;Now do you see the two ways out? We either stick to the lockdowns etc, or we get everyone vaccinated. This sub seems to be against both

yea, lockdowns dont work and the vaccine is very worrisome scientifically - we should just let the damn thing run its course - its not the plague - we have treatments - you should go take a look at qcovid.org (oxford university funded)

Lastly - the vaccines kill people - thats not controversial, its demonstrable - the question I have had this whole time: If covid kills the old (average age of death from covid is something like 78) and the vaccine has been killing the younger - even if at low rates. Then aren't we just killing the youngest and most able of us to ""save"" the old?",-0.7889,1

Ivermectin


Ivermectin has been found to reduce COVID-19 mortality by 81%
https://archive.is/g11nU 

It’s also safe, inexpensive and widely available, with decades of clinical usage suggesting it has a “high margin of safety.”
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26954318/ 

In one trial, 58 volunteers took 12 milligrams of ivermectin once per month for four months. Only four (6.96%) came down with mild COVID-19 symptoms during the May through August 2020 trial period. In comparison, 44 of 60 health care workers (73.3%) who had declined the medication were diagnosed with COVID-19. 

https://www.ejmed.org/index.php/ejmed/article/view/599



If you were to say, tell me the characteristics of a perfect drug to treat COVID-19, what would you ask for?’ he [Marik] said. ‘I think you would ask firstly for something that’s safe, that’s cheap, that’s readily available, and has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties. 

People would say, ‘That’s ridiculous. There could not possibly be a drug that has all of those characteristics. That’s just unreasonable. But we do have such a drug. The drug is called Ivermectin.’ 

If it was universally distributed at a dose that costs ten American cents in India and about the cost of a Big Mac in the United States, he said, Ivermectin would save countless lives, crush variants, eliminate the need for endless big pharma booster shots, and end the pandemic all over the world.” 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011



In June 2020, a study also found ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with a single treatment leading to a 5,000-fold reduction in virus after 48 hours. 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011



3.7 billion doses have been administered in the last 40 years, with serious side effects extremely rare 

https://www.mountainhomemag.com/2021/05/01/356270/the-drug-that-cracked-covid



“‘We have a solution to this crisis,’ he said. ‘There is a drug that is proving to be of miraculous impact,’ ...‘When I say miracle, I do not use that term lightly. And I don’t want to be sensationalized when I say that. 

It’s a scientific recommendation based on mountains of data that has emerged in the last three months … from many centers and countries around the world showing the miraculous effectiveness of Ivermectin. It basically obliterates transmission of this virus. If you take it, you will not get sick.’” 

https://covid19criticalcare.com/ 

Mexico City starts handing out Ivermectin to the Covid positives, hospitalizations plummet. Facebook still tells me Ivermectin is dangerous and I should get the unapproved vaccine. https://trialsitenews.com/mexico-city-wide-innovative-population-level-study-administers-ivermectin-based-home-kits-with-drastic-reduction-in-hospitalizations/ 

India covid cases plummet 80% to 90% after states embrace Ivermectin, one state bans ivermectin treatment: cases have tripled https://www.thedesertreview.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/is-ivermectin-the-new-penicillin/article_b6b7afd8-bd77-11eb-8259-af11e3c83aea.html


How it works


Firstly it docks to ace2 receptor sites so when sars-cov tries to use it's  spike protein (the proteins the vaccies teach your body to produce via  rna) to latch onto the ace2 receptor, it is completely blocked from  doing so. 

Can't latch on, can't infect. Ivermectin literally docks itself to the spike protein and the receptor for that spike protein. 

But wait there's more. 'ivermectin binds to glutamate-gated CHLORIDE channels bin the membranes of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells causing INCREASED PERMEABILITY TO CHLORIDE IONS, resulting in cellular hyper-polarizarion followed by paralysis and cell death's 

Not only does it get directly in between the sars-cov spike protein and  the ace2 receptors it binds to (preventing further infection) but it also opens channels for chloride to enter cells and kill the viruses that way...like a disinfectant.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32871846/ 

IVERMECTIN: the wonder drug suppressed for its effectiveness against ""COVID-19"" and SAFE alternative to experimental mRNA injections, is now also proving to be the long awaited miracle cure for cancer without harmful side effects to the patient. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7505114/

Only the main stream medias claim that us who are critical of what happens say that.

But reality is, that Corona virus is used as a mean to another goal, and that is global control!

First though vaccine passport, and later there will come vaccine chipping (And vaccine chipping DONT mean that you get the vaccine with the chip, thats the propaganda the media claim) vaccine chipping just means, that you will be chipped to prove you take the vaccine. In some years you will see that all stuff will be with scanners, and the scanners will need to scan the chip that is giving to people.

You can believe it or not.

American companies that is part of the this shitshow already force there coworkers to it, and medical chipping is already accepted by FDA.

Blood clots after vaccine are caused because of massive vascular system damage caused by your immune system. You have INTERNAL BLEEDING because your BLOOD VESSELS GET PUNCTURED by your own immune system which is clearing cells infected by the mRNA. Your claim the mRNA ""gets degraded"" is false. Most of your DNA is inactivated viral DNA. Your body stores and catalogues the information of past viral infections in order to recognize it later. That is literally how our immune system databank functions. The T cells store that information long term. It becomes part of your DNA. 

Your body continues to produce the protein spike for an undetermined period of time. There are unknown consequences to fucking with these mechanisms for sure. Anyone saying otherwise is a complete and utter liar and fool. I seem like a smart guy because I am smart. 

Apparently smarter than most doctors. Definitely smarter than you.

MRNA doesn't ""live forever"". It is code that your body reads and produces a protein chain based on the codon chains in the mRNA strand. Your body integrates that information FOREVER. 

There ARE in fact massive quantities of infected cells once you take the vaccine. Every single cell that receives one strand or more of mRNA is infected. A virus is literally a lipid capsule with a single strand of mRNA in it. It's a virus designed to protect you from a virus. Literally.

Period. 

Fact. 

By definition.

The same way any cell that gets penetrated by any virus is infected. 

Literally everything you said is either completely false or an utter mischaracterization of the true mechanisms that your literal millions of years old automaton of a body does. This is also why most people think the same way you do, you have been either lied to, are completely ignorant, are willfully ignorant of or cognitively dissonance blind to key details that completely blow apart your idea of what is happening because of your easily manipulable emotional state.

But do those other deseases also have a 3-5% death rate for people at the age of 65? Or around 12% for people above 80?

Keep in mind, these statistics are from countries like switzerland and england, countries with some of the most developed health systems out there. Also, these are averages, whereas the risk for men is a bit higher. 

In countries like anywhere in africa, or other less developed parts of the world, death rates are gonna be even higher. Even in america one would not want to be infected, because they don't have free health care, meaning if you're treated, you're gonna have to pay alot of money.

Everytime you take that shot/booster, your playing roulette. It's the same with flu vaccines as well, which is why I dont take them for something I get once or twice a decade. It just isnt worth it for me, especially knowing I am prone to ""unusual"" reactions, and have been most of my life. Looking back, likely auto immune issues caused by a free government vaccine for ""appalachians"". But i was lucky, that time.

It's up to each individual to weigh the benefit's vs the risk's and decide accordingly. No one is to dumb to decide what they want to do. The rich have been saying that for millennia lmao.

Really though, they want these vaccines to be leaky, and they wouldnt want to intentionally kill the ones willing to take it, for science! It makes more sense they are trying to breed deadly variants of the virus and they need as many people to take it for that to happen. When it does, those who are vaccinated will be fine, but the unvaccinated will likely die in droves. The ones who dont will be the ones who have a superior natural immunity. It's also the largest clinical trial performed on the unsuspecting masses, all in an effort to research ""the next generation"" of medicine, lmao.

This is the direct reason why twitter removing a user for breaking T&amp;Cs and businesses opening are not directly comparable. One of them is currently against the law. Now it's very easy to make the case that the law should be changed, but until it is, the post made by OP is a very shallow argument that just ignores the law and states that businesses can ""do what they want"". They can't, they never have been able to. There are thousands of business regulations on top of normal state and federal laws that prevent companies doing what they want.

It should therefore be up to that individual to decide how much risk they would like to incur.

If people want to cower in their homes in fear for the rest of their lives due to a minor respiratory illness, then so be it.  

This has been the problem the whole time.  We're being asked to live our lives as though we're all an 84-year-old man with diabetes and a heart condition.  Except, we're obviously not all that person.  That's stupid.  

It isn't the responsibility of the perfectly healthy to sacrifice their lives to accommodate the few vulnerable who are going to be in hiding anyway.  

Furthermore, the perfectly healthy people *should* be getting the virus.  

Give me the virus!!  I'll take it right now.  The more of us who have it and recover, the fastest this goes away.

We should not be advocating a strategy of eradication.  That is a bad strategy.  We should not be making it ""illegal"" to get the virus.

We should allow the healthy to live their lives as normal, and if they get covid, they get covid.  In well over 99% of the time, they will do fine.

And the virus will start to become more ubiquitous and benign.  

That will be the end of this pa-thet-ic ""pandemic"".  It will not be eradication (if that's the goal, we're fucked).  The end will be an integration of the virus into the human epigenome.  Like the flu.",-0.1581,5

He and Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg filed a petition with the European Medicines Agency on December 1, 2020. The petition asks the agency to halt trials for the Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b shot and all other mRNA trials until study designs conform with more universal methods.

&gt; One of their concerns involves Syncytin-1. The protein is responsible for placenta development during pregnancy.



Link to their formal petition to halt the mRNA 'vaccine': [here](https://thecovidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wodarg-Yeadon-European-Medicines-Agency.pdf). And [Source](https://newsrescue.com/doctors-former-pfizer-respiratory-vp-chief-scientific-advisor-file-petition-covid-vaccine-could-be-linked-to-infertility/)

One of their concerns involves Syncytin-1. The protein is responsible for placenta development during pregnancy.

The fact that AP, [Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/10/blog-posting/no-pfizers-head-research-didnt-say-covid-19-vaccin/), [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/technology/pfizer-vaccine-infertility-disinformation.html), and [Snopes tried](https://mattbell.org/mrna-vaccine-blocks-protein-that-helps-formation-of-human-placenta) so sloppily to  'debunk' it should give you pause, if you know anything usually the exact opposite of what fact checkers say is true, is actually true. And if you read their fact 'checks' carefully enough they're just using the same buzzword bingo ""experts say"" (wait isn't Michael Yeadon an expert??) and not providing any evidence to the contrary other than it hasn't happened yet. Well it's [already happening](https://fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/wisconsin-resident-doctor-has-miscarriage-days-after-covid-vaccine/281898). Maybe Snopes can debunk [this doctors miscarriage](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lf0ozj/pregnant_doctor_brags_about_getting_covid_vaccine/)

Michael Yeadon is the [same scientist who came out and said PCR tests are bullshit](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/former-pfizer-vp-no-need-for-vaccines-the-pandemic-is-effectively-over) back in November, which was ""DEBUNKKKKKED"" by the usual suspects until it was embraced as truth this month. Again he puts his name and reputation on the line and the best the MSM debunkers can do is a vague, anonymous ""experts say""

At the end of the day I can't point you to a MSM article that will cover this fairly because we know the MSMs job isn't to tell the truth, it's to sell a narrative. But i'll trust the word of Mike Yeadon over some paid propaganda shills any day.",0.8821,5

So, pal, the number is way high than .03%, and out of all those people who died, over 5% covid was the only cause mentioned. Meaning no other co morbidities were present, 5% still died, chief.

I’ve read as much of the emails as I can and they really aren’t that damning. The worst I could find were:

One page 3187, he’s first shown the lab-leak theory, and he sends it along to another researcher for more information

On pages 3147 and 3123 he receives emails with links to a study from India that claims the virus was spliced with HIV to spread more, but he debunks it and points out it’s not peer-reviewed, published, and didn’t stand up to replication. He links them to a debunking article.

On page 3087 he identifies for another researcher the background of the virus, explaining the likelihood of it coming from a bat and/or pangolin at a Wet Market.

Bonus: On page 1770 he reacts to merch made in his image.

Here are the pages of the leaked emails: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails?fbclid=IwAR2aZUmNotVdU_RuTrXaXH2jqSOOkQP7Mi-pf8C6K87nU_jD2eyXeKjzARU (they’re in reverse-chronological order)

Satan is the “god of this world,” he is the “prince of the power of the air” the unholy spirit working through the wicked. 

But having faith in God, the Most  High is a strength, not a weakness as you have probably been told.",0.93,31

Do you take comparable risk reduction measures for other risks because they're nonzero? Do you wear a helmet everywhere in case something falls out of a tree or off of a building, or wear a 5-point harness instead of a regular seatbelt in your car? Of course not, because there's some realistic threshold below which you consider a risk to be acceptable. Just saying a risk is nonzero doesn't justify reacting to it.

&gt;And for me personally, especially after switching to contact lenses, wearing a mask doesn’t bother me in the slightest.

Good for you, but many people are bothered by masks, and you don't get to dismiss them because you personally don't mind it.

&gt;“But government tyranny” there’s far worse issues, even surrounding this pandemic and corruption with it, than a private business asking to see a passport. Is it tyrannical when you get carded to get into a bar?

You don't have to allow yourself to be injected with something to get ID to get into a bar. The idea of needing a ""passport"" to go into a store is laughable.

Not even going to respond to the strawman arguments.

&gt;Maybe I’m the wrong one. But if I am I gotta carry around 2 extra pieces of paper. If y’all are wrong you can kill people.

No, if you're wrong, we lock everything down, ruin the global economy, cause worldwide shortages in everything from food to computer chips, erode people's freedom, force ""nonessential"" businesses to close down (in many cases permanently), cause massive unemployment and inflation, inflict widespread damage on people's mental health, prevent people from going to the hospital resulting in cancer and other diseases going undiagnosed and untreated, and spend billions of dollars developing and distributing vaccines, all for a virus with a 99.9% survival rate.",-0.9953,3

Like I mentioned earlier, living a good life and doing good isn't enough to save man from eternal damnation.

""The Spirit alone (which comes about by believing in Christ's sacrifice) gives eternal life. Human effort (morality) accomplishes nothing. And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life."" John 6:63

What contradiction? I'm not understanding what you mean by contradiction.

The old and new testament happened under very different circumstances and dispensations. Jesus Christ never contradicted the old testament. Jesus Christ and the events of the new testament  show that his sacrifice by dying for mans sin is a better sacrifice than the sacrificing of bulls and rams which was the way they used to atone for sins back then, amongst other things. One thing you also need to understand is that the Bible is a recording of real life events from the beginning of creation, shows how man fell out of favor with God and how God brought man back to right standing with him, how he will restore man and the earth back to how  they were meant to be and so lets us know what is coming ahead so we can plan accordingly.its not a fictional book written by a bunch of people who had time to kill lol.",0.836,1

I was on top of the low-waste movement well before all this shit went down.  

I have adopted the use of non-plastic home goods where able.

I buy cleaning products with either reusable or eco-friendly packaging.

I'm also a vegetarian, and if I eat out, I try to avoid places that use disposables in serving, and never use straws.   

So, being familiar with that which we call ""environmental waste"", it drives me up an absolute fucking **wall** when I see people in disposable masks, and even more when I'm out for a run and I see them scattered on the ground.

Which is ultimately the reason why I'm not convinced masks work.  If even a small amount of the population doesn't think used masks are a biohazards, imagine how most people treat them (that is, don't treat a cleanliness routine as a doctor in an OR might).  

And if most people don't follow strict cleanliness protocols, well...**why in the absolute bleeding FUCK do you think cases are going up despite mask mandates?**

In no particular order, the first that comes to mind is just general knowledge that Reddit is actually controlled by a small group of ""power mods"" which is like a half dozen or so people and these people rule their kingdom with an iron fist making sure that they control the narrative.  This sub represents something beyond their control and seeing this sub grow in popularity might be seen as a threat.

This wouldn't be possible however without younger generations growing up in a cancel culture environment where ideas and belief systems outside their own are seen as offensive and instead of just leaving people to themselves there is fundamental intolerance towards divergent thought that must be silenced at all costs.

Many of the people who harass our sub seem to spend a lot of time focusing their thoughts on some ""other"" that they have a profound and deep hatred of.  Which is why you see stuff like incel hate, Parler watch, top minds and the like.

If you are willing to get antibody test (this is not the PCR test), showing you have antibodies to covid, then that's your vaxx pass, allowing you to travel.  I think it's good for 3 months, after which you have to do another antibody test.  

As much as I hate these, it seems the 'better' option as opposed to PCR testing or the experimental jab.  Ironically, you would have had to get the 'dreadful' virus, to be able to show antibodies.

So I am someone who has actually unfortunately severe health anxiety
I freak out about antibiotics LOL

In the beginning I was terrified of COVID but came to terms with it summer 2020

Then you know I guess it started out with being interested in the Jeffery Epstein thing and certain parts of pizza gate- which automatically put me in that category of conspiracy theorist
I didn’t believe everything I heard, but I looked for patterns so I was already losing friends over that

I was skeptical of the thinking that sitting at a table for a restaurant would not be a risk to covid; but walking to the bathroom would be a risk

Anyways fast forward to vaccines coming out- idk right out of the gate I didn’t trust it because it had only positive outcomes reported which is statistically impossible… then when it was questioned I’d watch it disappear 
Then there were incentives to get it which was very odd
Then my parents started pushing me and all my family did and they wouldn’t even listen to an ounce of questioning and I was pushed by friends and was called a conspiracy theorist time and time again

And this is an experimental vaccine there’s no pamphlet they give with the ingredients- some life insurance companies are saying you now won’t be covered- and the makers of the vaccine cannot be held liable

I’ve gone through other subs and been fucking crucified- not with science but with cruelty about how stupid I am, and yelling at me that “the science” and everyone they know is getting it.. idk just no one is willing to even discuss the negative side effects 

And then my bf told me about this sub as I was expressing extreme frustration this morning lol",-0.975,2

That's incorrect. My statement is based off the words of the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, and a reasonable understanding of how the PCR test works.

Edit: in fact we can use your link, a ministry of truth ""fact check"" to determine the truth by reading in between the lines, and paying attention to the finer details that are buried under the other distractions, much as you do with a liar. Straight from your article: 

&gt;“After thorough investigation, WHO confirmed that tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. In particular, users in laboratories encountered problems with these tests when they did not apply the recommended positivity threshold – this can result in either false negative results (if the threshold applied is lower) or false positives (if threshold is higher).”

So there you go. Looks like PCR tests are being used inappropriately anyway, one way or another, but in fact exactly in line with what I was saying. Fact checkers are such jokesters, thanks for the link",0.7433,3

Making it intramuscular just means it's going into dense tissue, so it's got a good supply of blood coming *to* the area to expose your immune system to it, but it's also a good way to make it harder for the vaccine to flow *away* from the injection site in large quantities.

By my understanding, safety studies *were* run, but due to the urgency, they didn't go to the usual depth or breadth of testing. The studies weren't able to run for the durations they'd like - it's common to do follow-ups years later, which obviously hasn't happened here, given that it's only been a year or so; according to [this FDA page](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained), the COVID vaccines given emergency authorisation in the US went through a three-phase trial with followups on the order of one or two months after vaccination. I've heard that in some cases where they believed there was a sufficiently low probability of a thing happening (based on data from other vaccines that use similar mechanisms, etc) they may have skipped testing for those things, or only done cursory checks to confirm that it looked like the vaccine was behaving like others of its type, but I've been unable to corroborate this (and it's likely not the sort of thing they'd publicise).

The emergency authorisation is basically an admission that they haven't been verified safe to the usual standards, but they have been verified safe to the point where they think the balance of risks is such that the vaccine is probably better than allowing COVID to go unchecked. Whether they were correct in that call is something that we can't really judge until we find out exactly what they missed by not doing the full suite of tests. As you've alluded to already, there are reports of all sorts of things, so I guess when they determine which of those are caused by the vaccines and which are spurious coincidences, we'll be able to decide whether they were right to skip testing. I'd imagine that outcome will have an impact on future regulations, too; if it turns out that anything serious was missed, I'd expect a change to the rules on how they issue emergency authorisations.",0.5982,1

Biden, Faucci, etc are all verbally talking about the Covid jabs as vaccines (which is indeed buttressed by the data so far) while acting like it's a flu shot, begging people not to change precautions after inoculation.

I have a question for you, if you had a culture of covid RNA and someone suspected of having covid, how would you test him?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Are cultures of the isolated virus being used to diagnose Covid-19?   Labs have been growing influenza cultures in chicken eggs since 1938.   So are they growing cultures of Covid in labs to diagnose patients?  Yes  or no? 

Of course there are cultures in labs to research the virus, they aren't used to diagnose people directly, that would be stupid. Labs grow cultures, develop a test(the so dreaded PCR) and then it is mass produced and shipped to hospitals. Is it really that hard to understand?

Grow a garden, learn about which plants do best in your area 

Invest in a high quality firearm and become proficient in it's use 

Read more

Invest in a small but effective emergency solar backup setup for your home or vehicle 

Go to the gym or start a regular workout regimen 

Make a commitment to a better diet, learn about the importance of vitamin D and many other great additions and components of healthy nutrition

Organize with your neighbors face to face, figure out how to communicate when the power grid goes down or a natural disaster happens in your area.  Create a ""safe word"" or phrase even, so your network of neighbors can communicate under pressure

Learn how to can/preserve food

Build an emergency food and fuel supply, start with enough for at least one month of food and water per person in your household

Cancel your Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. subscriptions 

Buy and support local from people and businesses that support your freedom of choice

Show compassion when and where you are able.  Divide and conquer is the tactic at use against us all, compassion and realizing that we are in this struggle together will help neutralize it

Understand that you are not alone in how you feel, THERE ARE MILLIONS OF US IN THIS MESS TOGETHER.  Find one of us and start networking so we can build a more effective resistance",0.9924,1

I don't think there is any reason to rationalize that this is how every police officer acts on the job. There are certainly a lot of bad police officers, but they are far outweighed by the good police officers.

The veteran is currently suing the two police officers and will certainly win the case. So basically, they will be fired and serve prison time. I would say that is enough to be done.

&gt; In lower-income settings, it is more likely that reusable cloth masks will be used rather than disposable medical masks because of cost and availability (38). There are still few uncertainties in the practice of face mask use, such as who should wear the mask and how long it should be used for. In theory, transmission should be reduced the most if both infected members and other contacts wear masks, but compliance in uninfected close contacts could be a problem (12,34). Proper use of face masks is essential because improper use might increase the risk for transmission (39). Thus, education on the proper use and disposal of used face masks, including hand hygiene, is also needed.

And:

&gt; We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility (Figure 2). However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched.

&gt; **It is essential to note that the mechanisms of person-to-person transmission in the community have not been fully determined. Controversy remains over the role of transmission through fine-particle aerosols (3,46). Transmission by indirect contact requires transfer of viable virus from respiratory mucosa onto hands and other surfaces, survival on those surfaces, and successful inoculation into the respiratory mucosa of another person. All of these components of the transmission route have not been studied extensively. The impact of environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, on influenza transmission is also uncertain (47). These uncertainties over basic transmission modes and mechanisms hinder the optimization of control measures.**

Losing wars is way more profitable than winning them. Think about it - if you want to win wars, you will only start wars that you can win, which kind of, gravely reduces your opportunity for profit (you can't profit off wars you never started). Losing a war also takes a lot longer than winning it. Winning a war ends it forever, but if you are losing a war, like the US(or USSR) in Afghanistan, you can be losing for 15 years straight. War on drugs - they kept losing it for like 40 years. Losing a war is a long expensive process, and bureaucrats just love that. And bureaucrats are never at fault - they followed the process, listened to scientists, did the right thing, etc etc.

I am not talking 'profit' in monetary sense, but profit as a whole. Not just contracts for Boeing, but also the tense mobilization (now it's not the time for arguments - we are in a WAR, and you can repress whatever you want under that pretense), and also just people staying busy with bullshit, therefore having less time to think about of getting rid of you.

Condoms are used for this thing grown ups do called sex. During sex, the condom experiences friction (when one thing rubs against another, much like a crayon on paper.)  Normally this isn't too big of a deal for the condom, as during sex it's often properly lubricated and is able to readjust itself back to a ""comfortable"" position if it starts to stretch.

Now, condoms are made of latex (the stuff water balloons are made out of!) Latex is really good at creating friction between itself and other things, especially more latex. If you put two layers of latex on top of each other and subject them to friction (like two condoms during sex) then the latex experiences a huge amount of extra friction from the other latex. This causes heat and tension, the condom is no longer able to get ""comfortable."" It continues to rub and stretch in every direction until SNAP! It breaks.

Additionally, latex is very good at stopping stuff from passing through it (this is why they make great water balloons, the water can't leak out!) The point of a condom during sex is to stop the daddy from getting his daddy juice inside the mommy, otherwise the mommy might get a baby in her belly! If the couple isn't prepared for that, they might neglect the baby in many ways, including teaching them basic reasoning skills! Anyways, since a condom is made of latex it's EXTREMELY effective at stopping the daddy juices. There would be no need for a second condom in the first place! You don't need two water balloons to hold the water, do you?

Now MASKS on the other hand, are generally made of fabric (like your shirt, pants, and blankie.) Masks work by both diffusing (I know, big scary word. It basically means scatter) the stream of air coming out of your mouth so it's not all blasting directly at whoever you're talking to as well as absorbing some of the moisture (where the virus lives.) Adding a second mask will not create too much more friction like a second condom does since, again, make are made of fabric and don't often undergo much friction in the first place. What it WILL do is further diffuse the stream of air and absorb more moisture! This means there air you breathe out doesn't go as far and it's less likely to be carrying a virus! Fantastic!

Obviously this effect will continue to compound (get bigger) as we put on more masks, but nobody wants to walk around wearing 10 masks at the same time so we all settle on a single mask by default. I'm sure this news of multiple masks being more effective was just a way of helping out those among us that have a difficult time thinking hard enough to grasp these basic concepts.

I hope I helped you see how you can think things through and form a logical argument! It'll be a really useful tool once you get to middle school. Good luck, hope you have a good day. :)

EDIT: Also condoms definitely are a form of birth control, I realize now some of your confusion might have stemmed from not knowing what a condom is.",0.9971,0

If you add the likelihood of dying each year until then you get about 18%.

I'd say probably 4:1 or 5:1 odds of him surviving. So a good payout, but not crazy high. Also I'm not a statistician, nor am I accounting for the quality of care he's receiving. I'd say probably higher than that 10:1 on him surviving all things considered.

The survival rate globally is 99.85% because the ifr globally is .15%. The WHO had the IFR back in May 2020 at .23%...which is a survival rate of 99.77%. This isnt hard math. I know you want this to be the next 1917 flu and you think you are being virtuous and saving lives by following the guidelines and ""believing the science/experts"". The problem is the data doesn't support that conclusion. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1% that means covid is only 0.05% (ifr wise) more deadly.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; First of all, this 'great reset' isn't a thing, or any other conspiracies. They simply aren't true in any way.

First, on the great reset (5 seconds search):

[https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/](https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/)

[https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/)

This is directly from the world economic forum, not some ""conspiracy"" we invented. And world 'leaders' meet annually to discuss these affairs. Now try again denying it, I can feed you of these documents by different powerful fundations all day.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; It is true that most economies will be hit badly over the next few decades mainly due to the relief payments that have had to be paid to millions of people. However, it is generally accepted that the 'payback' of this will be spread over as long a period as possible to minimise impact on any particular timeframe. 

  
In those countries that got some pity money. In mine, noone has seen a dime yet (Luckily I don't need it, but there are people who do). But goverments care so much about us that they raise their salaries, which mean more taxes. Meanwhile hunger queues are growing on a daily basis and food banks don't get any help either.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  Interestingly you mentioned bill gates, possibly the most generous billionaire in terms of money and expertise when it comes to charitable donations. 

The same guy that runs experimental vaxes in third world countries and is banned from India? The same guy that funded all the main vaxes and is the biggest ""donnor"" of WHO through his ""Foundation""? The same guy that is the biggest american land owner? lol If you believe he is not in for business you are incredibly naive.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If you believe that this pandemic is purely for profit, then surely it would behove medical companies to merely produce treatments rather than vaccines? 

It is not just for profit, but it became political in order to seize individual power and freedom. Also, big pharma produces vaxes? Hilarious. You do have to take the flu shot every year, right? And as you mentioned, all Covid vax does is to prevent symtoms, therefore it is a treatment. Cancer takes away trillions for very little success everywhere in the world. It is a highly profitable business that if someone was to discover a cure, it would be a huge loss. No wonder why all scientists that are close to discovering one end up dead by suicide or something. Of course, you finally accomplished your goal that was to save millions and first thing you do is to take yourself away.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; who are you talking about?who are these people? Give me actually evidence (that isn't nonsense conspiracy I might add). And the world is not going to be 're-shaped' as you put it, we are largely going to return to normal in 2/3 years once vaccination reaches a level to which the virus is more or less killed off.  

Again you come at me with the nosense conspiracy. Here you go:

[https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/) \- October 2019 by the way  
And many more organizations that work with WEF in order to re-shape the world.  
Also, come on, don't be delusional. Do you think that people who want power and control over the others are going to come out in the mainstream media saying ""I plan to control the world"". lmao All I can do is to follow the money, a work that any human with hands and a critical non-lazy brain can do.

&amp;#x200B;

We have people here in Massachusetts who have been virtue signaling and haven't left the house since March.  Some lost their jobs and went through their savings.

Different devices tended to do different flavors of the same thing that would eventually end at the point for me.

Screen radiation up front would give me burning like sensations on my face and lead to intense brain fog if  exposure was long enough. Radiation from say a processor in a computer/console would give me the most flu like issues and interact with my sinuses the most (which by the ends of exposures to all of these would often be mostly closed up to the point where I almost couldn't breathe through it).

I survived on a combinations of food grade sodium bentonite clay, artemisinin, Cistus Incanus and cloves tea, Propolis, and black walnut.

See if she finds the presentation by Dr. Edward Kass interesting. Dr. Kass was a founding member and first president of the Infectious Disease Society of America and the founding editor of the Journal of Infectious Diseases:
http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/EHKidsc.pdf

This epidemiological study is useful as well:

As an example, measles death rates per 100,000 population *before* vaccine was introduced:
1900: 13.3; 1910: 12.4; 1920: 8.8; 1930: 3.2; 1940: 0.5; 1950: 0.3; 1960: 0.2

Then, if she wants to look at neurotoxicity, she could start by adding up all of the mcg of aluminum injected (bypassing the digestive system) and compared to studies of low birth weight infants given a similar amount of aluminum. Also look at synergistic effects between aluminum and glutamate.
Maybe one day she’ll help create safer vaccines!

If she’s talking only about the COVID-19 vaccine, she can look at information here and read through the cases:

There is no party, to date, that would drag Italy out of the European financial concentration camp.

""Influenza remains one of the world’s greatest public health challenges. Every year across the globe, there are an estimated 1 billion cases, of which 3 to 5 million are severe cases, resulting in 290 000 to 650 000 influenza-related respiratory deaths."" 

Yeah you're right, it's about half as lethal, but that's also assuming proper testing took place for covid, *which it didn't.* PCR tests have been found to use up to 35-40 cycles to find covid. That's too high, meaning there are, and could be more, false positives than positives.

&gt;And you don’t have to die from it or even be symptomatic to spread it.

Asymptomatic transmission is nearly none though?

I'm certain people would follow these measures if they were 50% effective. Since they have minimal ROI and cause more long-term harm they're not worth it.

The skittles analogy doesn't make much sense. The assumption here is everyone who gets the virus dies. You cannot calculate mortality using cases/deaths. The real mortality has more unknowns than you think. You have the unaccounted pool of an untested population and make the assumption they are neither infected nor survivors. The proper mathematical formula to calculate mortality is (total_pop * (total_pop/isolated_pop))/deaths

Now you need to define your unknown of isolated_pop. The other unknown is deaths because dying with Covid is not the same as dying from Covid. Deaths are a highly volatile figure as a definition of a covid death is inconsistent.

These vaccine types have been in the works for well over a decade - building and validating the science block by block. So while it seems rushed, the reality is that the bits and pieces of the vaccine have been well studied over decades and deemed safe. 

The other piece is the mRNA or DNA but that sounds familiar to anyone who took high school bio. While those are the bits that make the immunogen, they are relatively short lived in your body. They do not get integrated anywhere into your DNA and they fall apart quickly. This also helps with the safety profile.

Definition of [capitalism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism):

&gt;an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market

It doesn't mention government, which the West has, and it does mention a free market, which the West doesn't have. Therefore the West doesn't fit the definition of capitalism.

&gt;an economic system in which private capitalism is modified by a varying degree of government ownership and control

Now that's more like it. The West has government ownership of land, roads, schools, prisons, etc. The West has government control over laws, the market, and the currency.

So funny story, I can't find US deaths by year on Google. And by that I mean a simple chart that goes year by year. First result is the CDC that only has one year of data and it's by causes for some reason. Some graphs with percentage points for... Some reason. 

Yet first result for Sweden is [exactly what I want](https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/). A simple chart. 

Canada [is close](https://www.statista.com/statistics/443061/number-of-deaths-in-canada/)

U S... [only goes up to 2018](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195920/number-of-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1990/)

So tell me, why would it be hidden? Why would they hide data?

The 5th or so result was even a politifact article. I'm coming across propaganda before the actual facts.

I did come across this weird graph which [seems to show the US along the UN deaths prediction](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate) however, and I guess it's right where it should be? The graph is weird.

In 2018 there were 2.8 million deaths. The 2020 claim is 3.3 million deaths. Today's claim is 600k dead to the WuFlu, which includes 2021 mind you. 

Now the claim is that the WuFlu, which has shown to not be deadly to the young and healthy, to have a 95% survival rate in 70+, for the average death to be in the 80s, for the average death to have 4 comorbidities, to almost exclusively kill people who weren't already going to die is unbelievable. 

Let's dissect that 600k.

Of the top we know it's inflated by up to [25](https://californianewstimes.com/california-county-cuts-covid-toll-by-25-after-finding-some-deaths-clearly-not-caused-by-virus/381617/)-[33](https://www.yahoo.com/news/almost-one-third-covid-deaths-155426293.html?guccounter=1)% given other locations.

So that 600k drops to around 420k, which funnily enough only affects the WuFlu deaths, not the excess deaths. What would affect the excess deaths is a [50% jump in murders](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/06/953254623/massive-1-year-rise-in-homicide-rates-collided-with-the-pandemic-in-2020), [60% of Americans gained weight](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-covid-15-if-only-this-is-how-much-weight-the-average-person-actually-gained-during-the-pandemic-11615574913), with 29 pounds being the average. 10% gained 50 pounds.

Obesity is lethal, it complicates everything. 10% of Americans gaining 50 pounds likely caused a high ammount of heart issues and deaths.

Then of course suicides, if we assumed called correlated with actual deeds, we're looking at [300k from a 800% spike](http://fox17.com/news/local/feeling-the-pressures-of-the-pandemic-suicide-hotlines-see-800-percent-spike-in-calls)

So no, I don't think that assuming the fraudulent WuFlu death count matching a likely fraudulent overall death count is in any way proof of the WuFlu number being accurate. Hell, it's less likely to be real due to the overlap. Again, the primary WuFlu death was a frail elderly person with bad health. Not America, but [80%](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-long-term-care-cases-accounted-for-80-of-canadas-covid-19-deaths/) of Canadian deaths were in Long term Care homes where people literally unable to take care of themselves reside. 

And you want to claim the Venn diagram of ""WuFlu deaths"" and ""litterally every thing else"" only has a 6% overlap?

That's illogical and literally goes against everything known about the virus. This is literally 2+2=5.

So no, I do not see any correlation between excess deaths and WuFlu deaths. 

&gt;think again before you think they're inflated.

The California county above with a 25% inflated death count came out after your ""debunking"" article. Oh, and using such propaganda isn't a valid discussion tactic.

&gt;so where'd you think these came from if not from Covid-19 ?

Suicides, violent crime, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, obesity, domestic abuse, medical mistreatment, etc. 

&gt;Indeed, simply comparing the total number of deaths in 2020 so far to that of previous years shows a clear increase in deaths (Figure 1). And a CDC report estimated that between late January and October 2020, there were more than 299,000 excess deaths in the U.S.[1].

""Look at numbers"" isn't a valid way to dismiss an article. Try again. 

&gt;next, their level of lockdown

Which we know to do nothing. Try again.

&gt;they believe in the greater good to the community than the individual self.

China. *China*, the place with [forced prisoner organ harvesting](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-forcefully-harvests-organs-detainees-tribunal-concludes-n1018646) and [1.5 million Muslims in concentration camps.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_internment_camps#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DAs_of_2019%2C_it_was%2Cinternment_camps_which_are_located?wprov=sfla1)

Your praising a totalitarian shit state which is literally worse than WW2 Germany for their ""greater good"".

Again, no. This is such an illogical claim it doesn't even have a foundation in the truth. 

&gt;when they say masked up, they literally bash people who don't follow.

Which is why the right to self defence, and the right to bear arms is important. You're literally praising violence over an ineffective piece of cloth. 

&gt;freedom and individual rights take precedence.

As it should be. 

&gt;false, Lockdown works.

They do not.

In your second article it talks about France. The funny is is for a good long while Sweden had fewer deaths than France. They still do as well. Actually top of my head, 15k vs 100k, with 10 million vs 67 million population... France did worse.

New Zealand, Australia, etc are large island counties with strict borders and no real way in/out without anyone knowing. So the fact they're a totalitarian shithole, while a shame for their people, is irrelevant here when talking about a far larger, harder to control country like America.

&gt;China was the worst hit area initially.

3000 dead. Flat bar for a graph after that. Try again. 

&gt;lockdown for a year ? wasn't it more like 2.5 months ? earliest date was march 21st latest being june 11th. where'd you get your 1 year from ? 

I'm including all restrictions, especially as people in Ontario can't legally buy items from specific items in a store.

What if they get the vaccine in order to protect others? If they become immunized, not only are they practically unable to be affected by it, but they also greatly reduce the risk of spreading it to others. So when others take part, the risk of spread is thereby decreased on a much more universal level than on the individual. This is basic math.

As for the comment below, look up the definition of a vaccine. No where does it specify any amount of time. A vaccine has one purpose only, to stimulate the immune system in order to work against an illness. A more advanced and longer lasting vaccine will hopefully be developed in the future, but for now if you want to reduce the chances of getting it yourself, or spreading it to others in social settings, this is one of the few options.

Keep in mind, I am not in favor of ""shaming' or ""forcing"" anyone. And I find it frustrating when I see people try to force others into it when many may be allergic to the ingredients, or have health problems which make them more vulnerable to becoming badly ill.

* being wary of mRNA vaccine technology, given its non-existence until now on the medical market (in spite of having been through some recent testing on humans)

* concern for effects of the vaccines, given that there have been precisely **0** medium- or long-term complications or effects observed

* concern for the probability that these very quickly developed vaccines that use extremely new technology will most likely become mandatory to do nearly anything in the coming years, including entering your workplace, entering businesses ranging from restaurants to cinemas to clothing stores, or travelling outside of one's home province/state or country

This doesn't mean that theory is being discounted by those who want measures which may act against it. It does take place in nature and in humanity. But we might have other reasons to do something which is 'unnatural' 

In the past for instance someone who had a severe disability may have been killed or left to fend for themselves  but today those people are generally looked after by the government in some way. You could make an argument and say this is counter to natural selection but a lot of people would consider that heartless. That doesn't mean that natural selection doesn't happen, it's just that we have other things at play such as empathy for someone who is in a position we wouldn't want to be in ourselves and who we acknowledge didn't choose to be in the position they're in.

Another example would be allergies. Some people who have allergies will die if they consume the things they're allergic to. But we may have laws which regulate that allergen information should be on packaging because as a society we want to make sure people can avoid things they are allergic to because we can empathise with others and understand that it's not good when someone tries to eat some food they think is fine for them but turns out not to be.",-0.9779,1

You realize there's solid research now proving that it is an effective treatment?    
Did you know that world leaders were being treated with hydroxychloroquine even back when they were pretending it was super dangerous?  (And that was always a lie, It has safely and effectively treated Malaria for over 65 years. 
 How did it *suddenly* become dangerous?)    
     
Ivermectin shows even better results.     
And other countries have successfully used both of them as effective treatments.      

The reason they won't approve either for the public as treatments for Covid-19 here is because if effective treatments exist it destroys the legal justification for the emergency authorization and the dangerous vaccines would actually have to go through full safety trials.   Also pharmaceutical companies wouldn't be making billions with expensive mandated vaccines when a cheap and effective treatment is available.",0.9574,5

If it gets inserted that is. Which is extremely unlikely to happen in the way you describe it, it's considered negligible: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910833/ 

&gt; You can't regulate that, since the mRNA just goes into a cell according to natural laws. The strands don't pick a cell they think will not hurt you, it can even cross the blood-brainbarrier. A study shows that most nanoparticles of the lipids are found in the ovaries (!), liver and adrenal glands (!). I will look it up for you.

This might be the one you're looking for: https://byrambridle.com/docs/bio-dist-eng.pdf 
The accumulation in the ovaries represents 0.095% (in rats) and this study found that ovarian follicular function is not altered (in humans, but not peer reviewed yet): https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.21255195v1  So combined with the negligible chance of integration, it seems like there's no indication anything problematic happens there. But of course, more data would be nice.

&gt; Quite unknown. An hypothesis is that they can do this by means of enzymes called integrase. But hey, no data!

As mentioned in the first source, that's extremely unlikely. I still can't find an example of mRNA entering the nucleus.

&gt; Good question, I think they are both dangerous without long-term data. No one knows exactly. I am just giving you the information I know, with my medical biological background. But do know that all is theory and nothing has been proven or disproven yet, making this mass mRNA-vaccination strategy dangerous.

I wouldn't say nothing has been proven or disproven yet, preclinical and clinical trials have already been performed.",0.7828,1

the efficiency filtration rate of facemasks is poor, ranging from 0.7% in non-surgical, cotton-gauze woven mask to 26% in cotton sweeter material [\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/#b0010). With respect to surgical and N95 medical facemasks, the efficiency filtration rate falls to 15% and 58%, respectively when even small gap between the mask and the face exists [\[25\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/#b0125).

Clinical scientific evidence challenges further the efficacy of facemasks to block human-to-human transmission or infectivity. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 246 participants \[123 (50%) symptomatic)\] who were allocated to either wearing or not wearing surgical facemask, assessing viruses transmission including coronavirus [\[26\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/#b0130). The results of this study showed that among symptomatic individuals (those with fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose ect…) there was no difference between wearing and not wearing facemask for coronavirus droplets transmission of particles of &gt;5 µm. Among asymptomatic individuals, there was no droplets or aerosols coronavirus detected from any participant with or without the mask, suggesting that asymptomatic individuals do not transmit or infect other people [\[26\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/#b0130). This was further supported by a study on infectivity where 445 asymptomatic individuals were exposed to asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier (been positive for SARS-CoV-2) using close contact (shared quarantine space) for a median of 4 to 5 days. The study found that none of the 445 individuals was infected with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/#b0135).

People being idiots with ordering stuff during covid.  I periodically order specialized equipment for my company. There was some slow down for some specific things, but not terrible and delays were generally of a fixed predictable time. However, where we started to run into problems because people started ordering early to ""get ahead of the slowdown"". This created some artificial order volume which did lead to longer delays.

Humans have one major reverse transcriptase: telomerase, which carries its own RNA template. It doesn't just take whatever mRNA is floating around in the cell and integrate it into the DNA. No living thing could survive that mess. 

You also fail to address how the mRNA gets into the nucleus in the first place to be integrated into the DNA. Considering there literally is no evidence to support that humans even have a mechanism to accomplish that naturally (source: am med student, pretty important principle in genetic theory), I think we both know the risk of that is about the same as getting hit by a meteor.

Honestly, you seem like an intelligent person, much more so than the rest of the idiots in this cesspool of a subreddit.

I don't have any particular views about the dangers of vaccines; I just find the authorities and the agendas to be so untrustworthy and so potentially nefarious that I conclude I'm better off on my own.

either way I'm not sure what question you're asking or what information you're trying to get out of me. But I personally have no interest in taking a COVID vaccine, first, because it doesn't really concern me whether I actually get COVID or not, second, because I'm already pretty happy with my body and I don't care to alter its functionality by putting some extra man-made shit into it.... but third, most of all, because there's obviously some global political agenda unfolding alongside this COVID, and it's no secret, vaccinated people will need to be distinguished somehow and kept track of, in order to make sure unvaccinated people aren't continuing to travel and potentially spread the virus, which is the whole point of the thing to begin with. This is really the only way the vaccination campaign could possibly make any difference, so it's reasonable for me to consider these things guaranteed.

now, to clarify, I'm not one of those people who is particularly worried whether he is being kept track of or not. That's not really my jam. It's whatever. It's pretty hopeless either way, I feel like. However, it comes back to the untrustworthy authorities. If there's such a push to get everyone vaccinated, to the extent that unvaccinated people will be restricted from traveling and who knows what else, incentivizing very strongly that everyone is pressured into being vaccinated, this shows me that it is very advantageous to someone, to some agenda, that we are vaccinated. So while I may have no particular data about the vaccine at all, and no reason to believe it's harmful or any other thing, I have strong reason to be suspicious because nefarious actors desire very much for me to take it. What do these actors care about? Is it my health? Is it your health? Fuck no. They care about how to exploit us and exercise power over us, and that's it. So if they have a good reason to care whether I take the vaccine, that more or less translates directly to my having a good reason not to take it. Especially when I can look around at auxiliary things and see, for example: I don't fucking need it. You don't fucking need it either. And so on.",0.9515,1

( me too ... i would love to see a reality without courts/police/army/prisons ) 

its helpfull to know that in a monarchy, where the human being who is calling her-/himself ""the sovereign"" demands every human being living under its rule who is handling weapons to defend the governements and or the interpreters of laws ideas of what is okay and what not ...   
she demands of all members of parliaments as well as all members of police and army to take an oath of allegiance to her   
and she believes that ""the grace of god"" made her to be ""the sovereign"" over all people who indentify themselves as canadians ... and if that was not enough ... she also demands to be adressed as ""Defender of the Faith""   
so ... me feeling real crazy right now, like what am i doing here ... but lets get on with it ... this whole construction is pretty solid ... interweaving christian religion with domination powers of one human being positioning itself as having the authority to rule over millions   
of human beings ... and this all happening today ... in 2020 on the occupied space what i might call ... if that is correct ... turtle island   
but even when this whole constitutional reform thing looks to be a pretty heavy task ... what could be even more important ... is for this to be dismantled mentally ... to go trough it step by step ... see the flaws and faults in it from a position of a human being who does not   
agree with the concept that one human being should be given the powers to rule over millions of fellow human beings ...

there might be other ways how hundred thousands or millions of people could express an eventual disapproval   
of the concept of a sovereign appointed by the grace of god defending the faith ... a concept what basicly puts everyone identifying as canadian into a place of being ruled over by a human being who believes to be appointed by a christian god   
there might be a multitude of ways how millions of human beings could express their eventual unhappyness with being subjected to such a state of being ruled over by a monarch ... especially as that monarch has never attempted to revoke any of that ""assertion of Crown sovereignty""   
what is causing indigenous nations to spend a lot of effort documenting their relationship to their traditional territories ... 

like ... i have been in sunday school of the christian style ... and i remember ... ""say only one word and my soul shall be healty""   
""sprich nur ein wort und meine seele wird gesund""

so 

if she ...this one person, this human being who claims to be appointed by the grace of the christian god, defending the faith in this christian god...

if this one human being wants the soul of all human beings to be healty   
all human beings who live on turtle island ...

than she speaks that word what takes away the ""assertion of crown sovereignity""

as clearly no one can truly be healthy in the soul when one is being dominated by an other human being   
so even when constitutional reform seems to be a heavy task ... there are still petitions where millions of people could if they wanted ... write their names into a list to express their willingness to end this reign from this crown concept, end this monarchs reign as well as   
have no next monarch ...but wish for the nation state of canada to give up its confrontational domination strategy of colonizing indigenous nations bribing them with billions of money what has been promised in exchange of oil, gas, wood,weapons etc. by global investment companies   
a simple expression of disagreement ... like ... an anti-thesis to the oath of allegiance to the monarch ... 

an oath to a future canada what respects all indigenous nations original territories and their full and undisputed sovereignity on it   
a future canada what does not demand any proof from any indigenous nation but is a canada what gives thanks to the indigenous nations for being allowed to make use of some of the lands on turtle islands for those who identify as canadians   
despite all the legalese and most complicated encapsulated thousands of pages of laws and laws in several layers of interconnectedness ...

the raw primal magic what is applied in the colonizing ressource grabbing the earth and the human beings exploiting enterprise called   
nation state of canada ... this primal raw magic is simple:

set up a human being at the top of the structure ... let her demand all members of parliament and members of police and army to swear allegiance to her ... let her demand to be adressed as appointed by god   
and laugh all the way to the bank while the ones who are at the bottom of this set up structure are trying to puzzle the pieces together how to get rid of this colonial empire structure   
i guess there are a multitude of varieties how to dismantle this oppressive structure ... how to free indigenous nations of ""assertion of crown sovereignity"" ...  
and all of them different paths are important expressions of ...i or we do not want to live under the rule of an other   
human being ... i or we want to live in harmony with the fellow human beings which are neigbhours to us ... i or we wish for our neigbhours to be free from being ruled from above by a sovereign they never have sworn allegiance to",0.9978,2

But I also don't want them freaking thinking about anal sex when they're ten because that's fucking weird and unnecessary.

As I said in another comment, my *nine* year old has never so much as asked about exactly how babies are made or even where they come out of - those questions will come, I will always be honest with them and have always been open about their births etc but it's never dawned on her to be like ""hey but how did we get out ?"" It's not on her radar to care, she's busy worrying about the new Barbie doll that came out or whatever the heck else.

&gt;February 22, 2020 (000274-277)

&gt;Fauci confirms that “The vast majority of people outside of China do not need to wear a mask. A mask is more appropriate for someone who is infected than for people trying to protect against infection.”

&gt;March 1, 2020 (000922)

&gt;CBS’s Chief Medical Correspondent, seeking to please Fauci, emails Fauci a link to his segment which he appears to repeat what Fauci has told him, including that face masks “may give some partial protection by catching droplets containing virus but the virus is so tiny the virus can go right through it or around it” and describing the origin of the virus as “jumping from animals to people.” Fauci responds with “Outstanding!!” apparently pleased that CBS pushed Fauci’s narrative that the virus was a natural jump from bats to humans.

Tbh though absolutely noone needs to 'prove' masks don't work because we all knew they didn't, right up until around May 2020 when suddenly all the messaging changed despite no changes to the science.  I fully expect you to find some reason why this is all fine, that the messaging didn't suddenly change, that all the emergency pandemic plans from every country prior to 2020 recommend masks (they don't - the opposite), that you can find one single graph from any country where the introduction of mask mandates had a confirmed impact on infection rates (you can't), but tbh, I couldn't give a single shit what you think because the truth is the truth, even if you don't want to admit it.",0.83,2

At the start you said, ""I'm healthy so im not spreading the disease"". This is so insanely not true. You can be asymptomatic and spread it. Just because you aren't getting sick with it doesnt mean other people can't.

False.  Swine flu presents itself very quickly.  We had our only lockdown in April because we were still learning about the virus and how it spread etc.  And, as we learned, Covid has a two week incubation period.  So yeah, they're different, and implying they're the same because it's convenient is fallacious.

&gt; And they got returned or thrown in the trash

Also false.

&gt; People do not go to parks to meet people, they come to exercise and thats it.

I like how you can assert this as you also assert that you sat at home and did nothing for a year.  Only one of these things can be true at once.

&gt; WHILE WILLFULLY IGNORING DATA THAT THE ELDERLY AND OBESE WERE THE MOST AFFECTED BY COVID.

Yup, the country where the leading cause of death is heart disease due to things like hypertension, which, wait for it, happens as a comorbidity of obesity, was totally out of line to worry about obese people, fully knowing that it has the 12th highest obesity rate per capita worldwide.  Yup, totally out of line.

&gt; You mean states that did not lockdown like wuhan did and wielded residents in their homes.

Liberal states had a huge problem with it.  Incidentally, they are states where it tends to get cold early and people spent time together inside.  Look at Covid rates in the Northeast and upper midwest.  Not to mention how your rate of contracting Covid in a place like Texas has been incredibly high all year.

&gt; When was the last time you held a mayor accountable when they broke their rules?

I'm from a state that regularly indicts its Speaker of the House for corruption charges.  Holding people accountable is an accepted part of life where I'm from.

South Dakota isn't going to hold Kristi Noem accountable for causing the death of a ton of people that could have been avoided had she done the bare minimum and accepted that Covid was indeed real.",-0.8987,1

They wore masks out of courtesy to avoid infecting others with the flu, the cold, or whatever they were infected with. Also, all you anti maskers and anti vaxxers are the ones cherry-picking data.

Point 2: I would be hesitant to agree. This is a coronavirus and I don’t think we have enough of experience with it to have reliable data to forecast the severity. Maybe it gets less lethal maybe it gets more lethal. I also believe that because it is already killing at a fairly low rate (not insignificant) the evolution definitely has room to become more deadly and still be highly contagious. For the rest of your part, I can’t speak on behalf of your government. I live elsewhere. 

I think the severity of lockdown is overrated. I understand the strain it puts on economies however I think this is proper risk management in order to manage not only the health of those with COVID, but also those who rely on a stressed out system. I’m from the frame of mind that you can recover economically from this, but the premature deaths will never have a chance. Realistically we can put the world on hold and still have food on our plates. We can still work inside o houses and we aren’t ruining the system but asking it to adapt with growing pains. In many ways this has caused us to advance the system our economy live in to one that capitalizes on technology, and has created a need for us to adopt it. I think we have a good base to rebuild. We will have access to cheap credit and this will help towards a rebuild. There will be opportunities moving forward. I understand that this is far from a rosy situation, many people are being hugely effected in a negative way. I just wouldn’t paint it as polar as seems to be portrayed in this sub.

That's not what the table means. It has to do with what is listed on the death certificate. The Covid AND pneumonia column is where both are listed as the main causes of death. The other column is where the patient had pneumonia, but it wasn't necessarily listed as a cause of death.

Why did they do this? Because pneumonia is deadly. If the patient had it, then it is likely it contributed to the person's death.

This makes a lot more sense than including random pneumonia deaths in a table about Covid mortality.

In ancient cults or religions, objects would form the basis of rituals.
Rituals keep followers engaged and connected to their faith.

A really interesting question for me - that I ask myself - is why are people afraid - my conclusion was - Masks spread fear.

Masks are a form of non-verbal communication.

We know ""Herd mentality"" is a real phenomenon in humans.

We'd like to forget the great toilet paper rush of 2020 - but it happened.

Would people be be more likely or less likely to wear a mask if the majority of people they interact with were not wearing them?

Masks are our principal physical connection with the events of the last year.

I guess I was naive. I thought people were being ridiculous about guns here in the US. They thought school shootings were fabricated to take our guns and it made me sick to my stomach to watch them make fun of school shooting survivors when they pleaded for gun reform. And I really hated the Trump worshipping some people were doing. 

Then covid hit and nothing made sense anymore. The media was blatantly sensationalizing everything. Masks don't work. Masks do work. Masks are mandatory. Stay six feet apart. Stay ten feet apart. Wear masks inside your homes. Just two weeks to slow the spread into stay home until we get a vaccine into here's a rushed, never before safe enough for the public mRNA vaccine into the vaccine isn't going to change anything. Etc etc. So I started understanding why people believe conspiracy theories and how they may not even be wrong.

They’re saying they won’t now, as vaccine compliance has been good so far in the UK. Let’s face it, most of the care home residents wouldn’t have even known what was going on, and most likely never gave consent. It was just Nurse TikTok saying “come on, luv, just roll up you’re sleeve, one quick jab and you can have another Custard Cream”.

But now they’re getting onto younger generations, they’ll see more pushback, especially with the countries refusing AZ, which will lead to...

“Boris Johnson will be holding a press conference at 5pm today”

Everybody gathers...

“On the whole, turnout for vaccine has been tremendous, apart from the selfish people who want masks and lockdowns to continue, who have refused this perfectly safe vaccine.

We have decided that for the good of the nation, and indeed our friends in Europe and the rest of the world, that a clear and coherent record of those that have been vaccinated must be kept and should be easily visible to avoid unnecessary delays and paperwork.

Just to be clear, we are not making the vaccine mandatory. We are a democratic nation and do not engage in forcing our citizens to undergo any medical procedures.

However, should you decline the vaccine, this should be immediately known to those around you. We are therefore issuing cards, similar to the EHIC, which will state the date and type of vaccination, and can be shown at ease to any individual, business or facility to demonstrate you no longer pose a health and safety risk.”

Every little kid on the planet asks their parents why there isn't a vaccine for the common cold, and the answer is always the same - we can't do that because it evolves super fast and the new strain doesn't care about your immunity to the old strain. I can say with absolute certainty that most people wish there was a vaccine against the common cold, and a successful vaccine for it would be worth billions, but we don't have the technology to make it work at this time.

Covid isn't the common cold and it's not the flu, but it has the same problems. You can get a flu shot last year and still get the flu next year. You can get a shot for covid-19 and then get rekt by covid-20 or 21 or 22 and so on. This thing will never go away, but our treatments for it will improve over time.

You can't just claim ""all this stuff is deep state"" without showing proof of who is in the deep state, how this works (particularly with the examples you've given), it's dishonest. How can you possibly know all of those things are deep state, you must have evidence somewhere surely?",0.6901,1

Do you know *why* the death toll was so high for the black death? Because it was the god damn 1300's. They didn't have the modern medicine that we have, **700** years later. They didn't have a way to detect it before it was too late. They didn't have a way to track it. They didn't have a way to really study it apart from picking apart the dead. They didnt have the systems in place to do things like mass lockdowns to prevent the spread like we do. 

The Black Death was spread by contact with animals and fleas. Covid is spread by transmission through the AIR. You only have to be in the same vicinity of an infectious person, or even just walk PASSED them, and you can catch it.

Kinda weird that you are objectively wrong.

Not a commie, but I am a libertarian socialist. Also I averaged 40-48 hours a week plus part time college this past year, so once again that is an objectively false statement. 

Also I do indeed take that as a compliment, cause ya ain't been doing nothing if ya ain't been called a red ;)

&gt; Eco is about to surge

Weird how the economy is about to surge all the time yet workers rights plummet, more and more labour value is stolen, and the Republican party has basically turned into some neo conservative fascist racist cesspool of lunacy, idiocy, and hate. But its ok guys the line of the graph went up :)

&gt; No reason to give people money

So people can live? We can afford a UBI for everyone under certain income thresholds depending how much you tax the pigs. If we can do that, then the government could finally fulfill one of its most basic functions at last and build a greater society, one that is more free from hunger, hate, homelessness, and so much more than any liberal or especially conservatives can ever provide.

Very easily.

I make a point of reading, watching, considering, evaluating a variety of positions on any argument. I very often sympathise with points of view that completely contradict my own, but I can still hold in mind the contradictions and understand their implications.

This is not hard. However, some people find it threatening to expose themselves to multiple points of view, particularly views they find disagreeble or which challenge their own deeply held ones.

If you look deeply enough into anyone's world-view, as long as it is a sincerely held one, you will find points of agreement and eventually points of resonance and accord which you didn't expect to find. Many people find this frightening, because people are actually terrified of changing their minds - they fear they will lose themselves in the process - in fact, it can be liberating when you start to practice letting more perspectives into your life. Some unnecessary antagonisms simply fall away and you see humanity in all its ugliness and ignorance and its beauty and its truth.

&gt;The effort of the Autonomous Communities to increase their capacity to detect Covid-19 in the last two weeks is bringing to light a greater number of positive cases, the vast majority of which are asymptomatic, and so the lethality of the virus has dropped drastically to 0.29% of the total number of people infected. This figure is close to what is surely the ""real lethality of the virus"", according to the director of the Coordination Centre for Health Alerts and Emergencies, Fernando Simón.

&gt;""The infected groups are younger, with asymptomatic cases, so the lethality rate has been progressively reduced since the peak of the pandemic"" two months ago, when between 13% and 14% of patients died.

&gt;The control of the situation in risk cities like Barcelona confirms that the measures are working

&gt;For Simon, the change in the average age of those infected thanks to the extension of diagnostic tests (currently, more than 70% of the positives detected are under 30 years old) should not relax the system as the population over 65 remains the most vulnerable. ""At this age, the rate of infection rises dramatically to 16% and 17%, and that is why we must remain vigilant,"" said Simon, who endorsed the precautionary measures being taken in nursing homes.

&gt;""However, no matter how protected they are, there are risks because the workers have families and friends and can become infected and transmit it to the residents no matter how hard we try to prevent it,"" Simon warned.

&gt;In Aragon, the number of deaths during the weekend rose to 38, almost half of the Spanish total (65 in total) and was mostly due to affected senior centers. Another route of infection to the elderly is the relaxation of prevention measures of the population (hands, masks and social distance) when they meet with groups of people who do not live with them. ""Today family, tomorrow friends, another group of friends and thus acts as an amplifier of the virus. It is summer and there is more relaxation but we must take extreme precautions"".

&gt;The Ministry of Health yesterday reported a total of 8,618 positive cases over the weekend, of which 1,486 were diagnosed in the last 24 hours, making a total of 322,980 people infected since the beginning of the pandemic.

&gt;The death toll stands at 28,576. The communities with the most diagnosed cases accumulated are Catalonia, which is in the control phase and the number of infections is decreasing, Aragon (which has not broken the curve) and Andalusia, where the cases are tripling. Madrid is also concerned with outbreaks in several neighbourhoods and in residential homes.

&gt;The director of the coordination centre was optimistic about this data, which allows us to expect controlled transmission of the virus before the return to work and school. ""The early response plan is being implemented and is working,"" he said, ""we have to see what happens in the next two weeks,"" he added. He particularly noted the drop in cases in the Barcelona metropolitan area, a city that, like Madrid, has higher risk characteristics than other cities.

&gt;Currently, an average of some 47,300 PCRs are being performed daily. The increase in rapid diagnostic tests allows for the detection of symptoms before a person begins to be infected so that they can be isolated and thus ""we are a little ahead of the epidemic"". In this sense, he said that the autonomous communities are doing an ""excellent"" control work.

&gt;The government is in favor of local confinement and supports the autonomies with reports. ""From my point of view, and I am not a judge, practically all the decisions are well founded and accepted, only a few have been rejected by the judges, perhaps for lack of justification in the measure"".

&gt;He rejected a legal amendment to allow autonomous governments to confine people without judicial justification because it violates the fundamental rights of individuals. In this sense, he appealed to society's awareness. In some Spanish localities, the local police have been ordered to monitor the movements of positive people and their contacts.

&gt;Fernando Simón was in favour of the audit on the management of the control of the epidemic that a group of experts had requested. The government is the first stakeholder, he said, ""it is obvious that we have to evaluate"". The examination could take place before the autumn if the epidemic is under control and doctors are not overburdened and can collaborate with the auditors. ""It's not easy, you have to set the framework for the assessment and find the right technical experts"".",0.923,1

nope, this is how humanity operates

by enforcing an experimental treatment? nope. and you are talking about healthy individuals minding their own business. no one is endangering anyone.

this one is laughable

But both of us struggle with the same issues. I'm hearing with autism and can't understand when masked people are talking to me. I relies a lot on facial expressions to understand and the masks are muffling the sound. My teachers refuse using a clear mask 50% of the times because of they sees the black one as more convenient and comfortable. They're certified in working with sign language, deaf and disabled. My ability to hear intonation/inflection and distinguish/recognize/remember voices have gone to shit the last years too.

When my teachers are using clear mask, I can't really hear what they're saying. So, I relies on a combination of lip reading, power points and gestures. ""Bird"" and ""verb"" sounds the same. ""Wall"", ""Walk"", ""talk"" etc. are basically the same. So on. Even with lipreading I miss out a lot because of it's hard to do, I'm a new beginner and my teachers are rarely facing their face toward me.

I've studied sign language for 2 months now, but is looking at my deaf class mates' interpreters because of I can't understand anything my teachers are trying to say when wearing the black masks. I also use power points which have a lot of grammatical errors on them because of my teachers haven't learned my country's language properly yet.

These are experimental gene therapy shots.  I got rushed into it by my wife and pressure at work back in March (Pfizer 2 jabs) and now it's too late.  I know I will resist a booster at all costs, even if that's my job.  I'm banking everything possible and just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Sacrifice is going to be required to get through this.

Edit: Also, I had Covid last year.  I have a postive PCR test and antibody blood panel to prove it.  Not like I trust PCR at all after what I've read.  Still, why are we rushing to jab everyone instead of seeing how long natural immunity lasts?  There's too many logical inconsistences that added up make this extremely troublesome.

I was in the process of ""Waking up"" when I got the jabs.  My gut told me something wasn't right but I did it because my wife has an auto-immune condition and her doctor advised her that both of us needed it.  My wife works for a health system so there was a degree of trust given despite the fact I had my doubts about the vaccine and had heard much of the critique going into it.

I feel like nobody granted true consent to these shots.  A lawsuit filed by America's Frontline Doctors states it best:

&amp;#x200B;

""At the same time, the American public, desperate for a return to normalcy following a year of relentless psychological manipulation through fear-messaging regarding SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and associated unprecedented deprivations of their constitutional and human rights, are being told in a carefully orchestrated public messaging campaign that the Vaccines are “safe and effective” and a “passport” back to the freedoms they once enjoyed. Dissenting medical opinion is systematically censored. Private sector employers and all levels of government are offering dramatic incentives to accept the Vaccines, and jarring penalties for refusing them. In these conditions, it is not possible for Vaccine subjects to give voluntary informed consent to the Vaccines, and the “warp speed” rollout of these dangerous, untested biological agents to the American population constitutes non-consensual human experimentation in violation of customary international law.""",0.7716,3

A lot events and such are funded by local businesses and municipal funds, municipal funding has been fucked due to decrease in tax revenue and local businesses are struggling to keep afloat so won’t donate.

They are also looking to chemically confirm the graphenes presence to be thorough. They were previously using a light-bouncing electron microscope technique that is accurate but this would be to further prove the graphenes presence.

Microsoft was instrumental in breaking IBM’s *actual* monopoly on the computer industry. If you think things are bad now or under Gates tenure as CEO then imagine a world where you could only buy computers built by IBM because they didn’t share their BIOS, which all the software at the time was written to run on, with any other manufacturers and sued anyone who tried to make “IBM compatible” machines into oblivion because THAT was the world we were living in before.

Without Bill Gates backing the EISA we never would have reached the open architecture standards we enjoy to this day and wouldn’t be living in a world where you can buy a computer from any number of manufacturers or even build your own and have it work with any off the shelf software.

The topic of monopolies in the tech industry is fraught with ignorance because technology is so dependent on compatibility and the standards that guarantee that compatibility that it becomes an industry that gives off the appearance of being more monopolistic than it is and if anything Microsoft and Gates deserves credit for being instrumental in making the PC industry far, *far* less monopolistic than it was before the days of windows.",0.4925,2

China is definitely primed to be the new world leader in the 21st century. With most US corporations kowtowing to them, as you said, why even need a war? China is already in the process of dominating much of the east with the Belt &amp; Road initiative, as well as having its big business buy up parts of Africa.

Thanks for pointing this out!

1. Only goes up to 50%, exaggerating the differences between the different statistics.

2. Sorted by percentage. It seems like way more people died from the black death than any other statistic, but there were only ~475M people alive before the black death.

3. Records statistics incorrectly. For example, the black death reduced the population from ~475M to ~375M, not even close to a 40% decrease.

4. Records not in relation to total cases, but to total population. A number that gets thrown around a lot is  .028 percent. That records the number of Covid-19 deaths to population (~7B). But of we take percentage of deaths from CASES, the number is approximately 1.7%, much higher and more accurate than .028.

Twelve were filed in Pennsylvania, six in Georgia, and two or three in each of the other states. Of course, there was also the lawsuit filed by the state of Texas against the state of Pennsylvania and a total of 80 suits. 

Georgia: Thrown out because Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was not a candidate for office nor the election superintendent who conducted the election, and therefore per state law, was not liable. The lawsuit was for 20K votes that were cast by non-Georgia citizens. 

Michigan: [Ruled moot since it was not filed until 4:00 p.m. on Nov. 4, after votes were counted](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/20201106-Opin-and-Ord.pdf). Videos of vote counters clapping as Republican observers were evicted and of covers being placed over windows. The judge on this case also said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson bore no legal responsibility for video monitoring of drop boxes nor of making video from such surveillance available, despite a recently passed law requiring surveillance of all drop boxes installed after Oct. 1.

Pennsylvania: [Metcalfe v. Wolf](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/12/Complaint-Filed.pdf), claimed “approximately 144,000 to 288,000 completed mail-in and/or absentee ballots” in Pennsylvania may have been illegal based on testimony from a U.S. Postal Service contractor. The contractor said he was hired to haul a truck of what he believed to be this many completed mail-in ballots from New York to Pennsylvania. The complaint also alleged there was “evidence” of ballots that were backdated at a postal facility in Erie. [The judge tossed it since the state’s Election Code required their request to be filed within 20 days of the alleged violation.](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/12/Memorandum-Opinion-Filed.pdf)

Wisconsin: clerks issued absentee ballots without the required written application, that they illegally completed missing info on ballots. [Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to hear the lawsuit](https://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&amp;seqNo=311669)

tcooke2, the reason the MSM is saying ""no evidence"" is because the courts tossed the lawsuits on a technicality to avoid exposing massive voter fraud. It's a lie that's repeated so easily by uninformed people that  have done zero research into the matter.

6. Is it constitutional to require clothes in public?  That's where.
7. Essentials are essentials, and the beach isn't.
8. There are exceptions. (I'll just secretly hate and ostracize anyone that wants to claim one.)
9. Did you seriously just compare this to the flu again?
10. Experts.  Every acceptable media outlet everywhere. (Except the CDC which you can't trust anymore.)
11. Do you want 2.2 million more people to die in the US?
12. Because science changes as we learn more, unlike you.
13. The medical community has discussed moved on from this.  Go read the double blind studies.  You Trumpers just can't let this go, can you?

If the government enforces a nationwide recall of Fords due to a malfunction, they didn’t just magically come up with that conclusion: it was probably informed by mechanics and engineers who are experts on the matter. Do you feel you can distinguish between experts you can and cannot trust on matters you aren’t an expert on? Have you asked your doctor about the vaccine?

Alternative idea: You *selectively* don’t trust people. **People** are responsible for science, vaccines, and medicine. So if you trust the process, but not the people doing it, then you are presenting some contradictory ideas, since the process is contingent on good scientists and doctors to perform those processes.

I never claimed medical malpractice doesn’t happen, so stop putting words in my mouth. I vehemently agree that some people are either greedy experts (pharma representatives, who don’t actually do research, they are just spokespeople) or pseudo-experts (claiming expertise on things that go against the medical record). This leads to medical waste, a primary factor of American healthcare going down the shitter.

I am well aware I can’t make decisions for people; stop talking to me like I’m 5 and do not understand the psychology of other people. You saying “the right decision is no” based on the conclusion that “bad people may exist in this world” is a paranoid gamble. Your air of superiority, I am finding, probably has little to do with science, but just the fact that the government is involved with it. Even though scientists developed it instead of politicians.

i can just see where this goes. 

you ask about similar diseases, i say flu, you bring up long covid or overrunning hospitals. i say ""never happened though"" re hospitals. you say ""cause of lockdowns"" and there we're stuck.

or i ask for data on long covid. how long is long, what are the common symptoms, how many people actually get it, how many have recovered. but i don't get a solid answer. I'm not sure that information exists yet.

or re ignorance of vaccine -- first that's insulting, especially since you learned it was mRNA about 1 hour ago.
second, i can talk about the side effects I'm hearing in my personal life til I'm blue in the face, but you can point to ""side effects are rare"" or ""better than covid"", so again what's the point.

third re supposed 0.15 rate -- first i showed you a bunch of studies that all point to that. second if i say ""eh it's like the flu"", you can pull out ""if it saves one life"" or ""if it ends this nightmare"".

anyway that's where I thought this was going. if I was wrong I am sorry for misjudging you, and sorry if I was rude.

Lets use the UK for example. In the UK, there was a total 616,000 deaths in 2018. These can be classified as non-Covid related deaths. 616,000/365 = 1,688 non-Covid related deaths per every day on average. 1688 \* 28 = 47,254 non-Covid related deaths every 28 days on average.

There are 66.65 million people living in the UK, so 47,254/66,650,000 = 7.09\*10^(-4) as the fraction of the total population that die every 28 days for non-Covid related reasons. This is equal to the probability of a random person being selected of the UK general population dying within the next 28 days.

As of the 10th of February 3,985,161 people in the UK have tested positive for COVID-19. From the probability above we should then expect that approximately 3,985,161 \* 7.09\*10^(-4) = 2,825 of these people to have died within the next 28 days from non-Covid related reasons. Overall 114,851 of these people died within the next 28 days, which means only approximately 2,825/114,851 = **2.46%** of COVID-19 reported deaths were caused by non-Covid related reasons. Hence the vast majority were not.",-0.9387,-1

Do you know that none of these countermeasures, literally none of them, were ever recognized previously to 2020 as being appropriate responses to a pandemic threat? What mechanism exactly would explain the widespread adoption of such measures, contrary to established protocol, at the very same time, if the governments weren't actively working together? I phrase this rhetorically because I know plainly that there is no possible answer. But if you disagree, please do knock yourself out and try to tell me the answer!

beyond this, it's not merely that parties worldwide are conspiring to report inaccurate numbers. Rather, it's that the highest authorities have each defined clear policies which dictate how the numbers are required to be counted, and those doing the counting are then beholden to those policies. There are extremely straightforward examples that can be observed by anyone, so that there is no reason for any confusion. For instance, policies that require diagnosing COVID with tests that are known to be unreliable, or policies that require diagnosing COVID according to symptoms that overlap those of the common flu. [Here is a nationwide mandate from the CDC outlining how COVID deaths are required to be counted.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf) You can read it yourself and see that it encourages deaths to be categorized as COVID deaths even without a positive test, even in the case that COVID is merely suspected of contributing to death. I'm not making these things up. These policies are real, they are widespread, and they are specifically designed to produce extremely inaccurate numbers.",-0.9587,1

Do the lockdowns and the economic destruction they've caused concern you?

Do you worry at all that if this is our response to a disease that we now know has a very low infection fatality rate, then these restrictions can be justified continuously simply to prevent the annual spread of the flu or othervlow fatality rate viruses that emerge in the future?

Do you think the world should ban international travel permanently? That would certainly help prevent the spread of any future outbreak.

Should we shutdown indoor dining indefinitely?

We just want to return to normality, but we're being told more and more that we will never be allowed to resume our lives as they were.

Don’t lump me in with those that do. I’ve been pretty cordial. But you haven’t sufficiently supported what you’ve said.

For your first article, sure the vaccines may produce better immune response against the spike protein. But that’s the only thing it’ll generate a response against. Natural immunity confers defense from the spike protein *and* the rest of the virus. If the spike protein mutates it’s the vaccinated people that are left vulnerable against the new variant, not us with natural immunity.

I’ll read your 2nd article later.

For your third, I have never even remotely suggested that natural immunity offers absolute protection. In fact I’ve acknowledged that some re-infections have occurred, but according to the CDC they remain rare. You seem to be suggesting that because maybe 0.1% of people with natural immunity end up re-infected that it is worthless. That’s silly. 

Some people also get infected despite being vaccinated. That doesn’t change that the vaccines are extremely effective. And safe.

Take care.

Edit: I read a bit of the 2nd article. It’s saying that the vaccine is preferable because then you don’t have the risk of getting seriously ill or dying. This applies only to people who haven’t already been infected. For those of us that have, it’s a moot point because I already have immunity.",0.9379,1

Feeling two realities is how it feels to be living with people in a cult and knowing the truth. You dissociate from the truth sometimes just to deal with those people during the day, but you feel the cognitive dissonance of those two realities, and it's painful, like a constant thorn in your side.

The same tactics are being used for mind control, especially social tactics like surrounding non-believers with believers so they'll agree with the doctrine in order to fit in, no matter how crazy it is. People by nature want to fit in with whatever group of people they're in.

The numbers of vaccinated people are probably being exaggerated to make people who refuse feel more isolated and feel more pressure to obey the cult leaders' demands.

Where does the study claim causation?

&gt;Some studies, like this one, do not support their findings because of corruption in either the way they collect data or an inherent flaw in the experimental design.

You're trying to dismiss the study on the grounds of it not being perfect and openly accounting for the possibility of a certain bias. That is ridiculous. Please stop embarassing yourself.

&gt;It is customary in scientific journals (you don’t seem very well versed on these unfortunately) for the researchers to speak to potential flaws in the manner in which they collected data or conducted the experiment.

Kid, you're the one who tries to dismiss the study because it contains a disclaimer.

&gt;The researchers themselves STATE IN THE DISCUSSION that there is inherent bias in the way they collected the data.

No. They state that they *cannot rule out* the possibility of a certain bias. Please, I mean, you have obviously never visited college. Again, just stop intellectually embarassing yourself any further, there really is no need.

&gt;I have some downtime at work so fire away kiddo.

You could start by not being so sensitive when I poke fun at your evident scientific illiteracy and instead respond to the much larger second part of my comment:

&gt;I'm not a fan of the lockdown and the anti-COVID measures. And my antipathy and worries about it are actually succinctly summarized in the name of this sub, that's why I followed the link a couple of hours ago. I don't want this to become the new normal. Obviously, I disagree with much of what this sub actually is. Imho this sub could have much more productive discussion (rather than just the typical reddit circlejerk) by focusing on the negative effects of the anti-COVID measures, but without childishly trying to dismiss their causes or their positive effects.

Yes we have more of acumen and technical ability. We also have greed that has expanded exponentially faster than technical capability or acumen. You have scientific studies saying that sodas are not bad for you; why? Funding came from the industry, dictating that results that contradict the premise they’re supposed to support are discarded. Who pays the piper calls the tune.

Knowledgeable individuals seeking whatever means they can to investigate, confirm and/or disprove theories leading to developments is how we think scientific discoveries come, but we have a scientific community that is underpaid (experimentation and studies are expensive) and largely dependent on funding from huge profit-driven entities that will blackball and ostracise those who have dissenting views, and use media to drown out opposition.

“If you can save lives why wouldn’t you” is your question and that’s a good one. Why would pharmaceutical companies suppress ‘cures’? Why would they make opiate-based medication that makes it almost impossible to quit a prescription? Why do you have a revolving door between the pharmaceuticals, FDA, and gov’t and myriad class-actions re: drugs with damaging side- or long-term effects? Why is that industry the largest lobbying force? Why would government grant immunity to them for products that can cause such harm, taking away any obligation to be careful? Based on all the above I simply would rather use a scientific approach towards them i.e skepticism until verified. “Trust the science” isn’t coming from the scientists. It’s coming from the gov’t and media. Why?",-0.4282,16

Yes, reasoned arguments backed by evidence and the experts in the field are going to keep rearing their head over and over in response to nonsense. You'll have to get used to that. 

&gt;If caring about other people is ""selfish"", then sure, sign me the fuck up, I'll be as selfish as one can be.

But fuck all the people who will die right, economic hardship is more serious than a mountain of dead right? 

I agree the economic impact is severe, I support the government stepping in and helping people, but a certain party that starts with an R won't let that happen. 

The dichotomy is not ""open up and let people die or lockdown and people lose everything""

&gt;People have died from disease since the beginning of time.

Not an argument, we should be fighting against the status quo to help people, not letting pandemic cause untold deaths because ""its just nature bro""

&gt;Where was all this concern in 2009 when 284,000 people died from Swine Flu?

You mean when the US mounted a global response to fight it? 

Oh, please don't be dishonest, that 284,000 was global. Heres the US stats 

From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus.

US deaths were 12k, you know, 12x LESS than our current covid deaths. We are almost to that global swine flu death toll in our AMERICA ONLY covid death count. 

&gt;Where is the concern for the 1.5 million per year who die worldwide of Tuberculosis or the 2.5 million who die of pneumonia (often a complication of a Coronavirus or Rhinovirus common cold)?

We vaccinate for TB and fight both of diseases globally, but why would we lockdown in the US for diseases overseas that we already have pretty much beat at home? This is some serious whataboutism. 

&gt;Stop pretending that death is a novel concept, stop pretending that COVID deaths are somehow more important or more tragic than deaths by any other means or from any other contagious disease.

I seek to prevent all preventable death where I can. You aren't making an argument. 

&gt;Are baseless assumptions and ad hominem attacks really all you have left in your arsenal?

Hello pot, im kettle. Im just saying if people in general would just wear a mask, social distance, and cooperate with contract tracing we would not have this problem. Look at South Koreas response and infection rates compared to ours for example.

&gt;Mitigation efforts such as distancing and masks prolong the total length of the pandemic by slowing the spread.

Correct, if we had slowed the spread in the same way places like South Korea did, it would be under control. 

&gt;Quit trying to gaslight people into thinking that it is somehow their fault that a highly transmissible respiratory virus is doing what nature dictates highly transmissible respiratory viruses do.

Yes, it IS peoples faults if they go to gatherings and don't wear a mask or socially distance. Its like saying ""fires are natural, stop blaming people for spreading gasoline in the fires path for the resulting damage""

Covid does increase that chance dramatically. Hundreds of thousands of people in the US have died due to either covid, or covid worsening other conditions. Even if that's an overblown number by 100%, that's still over 100,000 people dying because of this in one way or another.

So I’m gonna try to share some stuff again but hopefully it’s as thorough. 

https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.php

Go to that site and under 1. I would change it from age to symptoms. 
Go to 3. And click covid 19 under vaccines. Be sure to unclick “all vaccines” so it’s not as much to look at.
Then under manufacturer I looked at each one at a time yesterday. Jansen is j&amp;j. Moderna is moderna. Pfizer is Pfizer/biontech. If you wanna just see how many died you click yes under “died?” In step 4. But j have that data for you!

Do some math to see how things are looking. I think if you can avoid getting one you should but I’m afraid you’ll drop out and then your backup plan will require a vaccine now or in the future anyway... scary but just saying! Maybe you can do virtual until Novavax is hopefully available? I dunno! I’m gonna enter this comment in and then add some data onto it. I have a table in my Notes from yesterday but I have zero clue how to paste a table onto here. I’m a teacher so I’m not working right now and I’ve been enjoying some Willie’s Superbrew. I teach elementary so I’m no math genius but I like data lol. I think you could probably do better with the VAERS data than I! Also remember VAERS is only for the US. In the US apparently 12 million people have gotten the one time j&amp;j. 130 million have gotten at least one dose of moderna and 175 million have gotten at least one dose of phizer. People seem to be doing fine in the Novavax trials.

So in my table I show j&amp;j as having 42,359 people reporting adverse events to VAERS (remember the system likely only gets 10% or less of all events reported though). But I took that number and divided it by 12 million since that’s how many people in the US got that vaccine. So it looks like out of the 12 million .00352% had an event reported to VAERS. For moderna there were 186,352 events reported. So I divided that by 130 million and it looks like .00143% of people in the US who got Moderna had something happen that was reported to VAERS. For Pfizer there were 208,870 reports out of the 175 million vaccinated with it in the US, so about .00119% of those that got Pfizer in the US had something happen that was reported to VAERS. So j&amp;j got less reports but actually a larger percentage of people who got it had something reported since millions fewer people got j&amp;j. This was eye opening for me bc at first I thought j&amp;j seemed better based on the numbers but based on percentages not so much!!

For deaths j&amp;j showed 523 so I divided that by 12 million. About .00004% of people who got j&amp;j died and had someone report the death to VAERS (who knows how many never reported). For moderna 2,687 deaths were reported to VAERS so I divided that by 130 million. Looks like .00003% of those who got Moderna died and someone reported it to VAERS (again we don’t know if the vaccine was always the cause and there’s likely deaths caused by it that were not reported to this system). For Pfizer there are 5,814 deaths on VAERS. Divide that by 175 million and it looks like .00002% of US folks who got Pfizer had a loved one or healthcare professional report the death to VAERS. 

So J&amp;J shows fewer deaths and other adverse events. Looking at numbers it looks safest and Pfizer looks scariest! But do the math on VAERS and j&amp;j looks the worst... then moderna.. then Pfizer. If you read throw the symptoms list for each it’s interesting too! I’ve read way more stories about period issues from Pfizer and moderna but apparently .5% of people who reported to VAERS that got j&amp;j had heavy bleeding. It was like .35% for moderna and .47% for Pfizer. I think these percentages mean .47% of people who got Pfizer and reported to VAERS, so the numbers would be different out of everyone who got Pfizer and they could increase but I think the numbers would be smaller!

Other stuff I wrote down from VAERS (abbreviating each vax with first initial)
*I was in the site and making the table while listening to that podcast so I was kinda lazy...you can see the whole # on VAERS bc I didn’t write down the # but remember I think these percentages are out of the total reports to VAERS and NOT out of the total of millions who got the vaccines, so I think the percentages would really be a lot smaller for most of the symptoms reported ... but these numbers still aren’t amazing so again, it’s crazy they’re pushing these on healthy people but there’s a big chance you’ll be like a lot of my friends who had nothing happen! Just make sure you’re prepared and have health insurance incase you’re unlucky* 😟

I just kinda jotted down the percentages on VAERS for symptoms I’m most worried about or most interested in. Personally I’m worried about periods bc I used to get them heavy with bad cramps and I don’t want that ever again! And stuff live itching and hives bc I have super sensitive skin that once had mystery hives full body for two months. And then other stuff I jotted down like heart things and tremor and seizure bc I’ve heard of those happening and was curious which vaccines *look* worse for each. There’s TONS of symptoms on VAERS to see. I wish I wrote down the numbers instead of the % bc VAERS shows them side to side. Then I’d divide the number on VAERS by the total # of people in the US who got the vaccine. I think one of the vaccines showed like 117 reported blindness. If it was moderna I’d do 117 divided by 130 million which is about .0000009% and not anything like the percents on VAERS bc those percents are out of reports to VAERS for that vaccine. 

Hope that makes sense! Honestly going through the system made me feel less scared if I’ll need a vaccine. It also made me change my mind bc I thought I’d go for j&amp;j and avoid moderna... but moderna looks better in percentages and j&amp;j worse! I’ll keep trying to hold off for novavax and if I have to get one I’ll hope I’m like my bf and friends who got a fever or headache for a day and that was it. I don’t think the vaccines are safe though bc obviously they’ve ruined so many lives so they should be pulled!!!! But statistically thinking, if you HAVE to get one to go college I do think you’ll be okay! If you have any health conditions I would ask your dr if they recommend a certain one although they might be like “take the one you can get” but I know a few doctors in MA who don’t recommend any so some doctors will be honest! Just be like I have to get one so which seems safest for me? Bc if you do have any health conditions I don’t think the nurses at the vaccination centers are going to ask. I heard some lady didn’t know you shouldn’t get vaccinated if you’ve ever had anaphylactic shock and she went into shock and got a huge bill... and she was like umm they should probably ask if you have allergies or have an epi pen but they didn’t! So be careful and do research and choose the one you think might be best for you. If you have any blood issues I’d avoid j&amp;j. Heart issues I’d probably not choose Pfizer. Idk they all have risks but millions have had nothing bad happen after so you just have to think is this worth the risk for my
College and career goals?? And it very well may be worth the risk! Bc nothing might happen when you get a vaccine! It’s just that bad things *could* happen... but dropping out could ruin your career goals too. So just research like you are and weight those pros and cons for your life! We can’t really make the decision for you. 

And I’m done! Haha I get really bored as a teacher on break when everyone is working and it’s raining! Just enjoying some Willie’s Superbrew açaí pomegranate and sharing info that interests me! I love this sub and hate these vaccines but it’s a tough ship to be in when not getting it ruins something like getting a paycheck or continuing your education. I don’t mind if I can’t travel to Europe or something for a long time. Always wanted to see Canada but now I could care less if I ever see Montreal! People will downvote or laugh at me but I want my comment to help people who will face the threat of losing a job or losing their education opportunities due to these stupid vaccines. If an employer told me I needed a vaccine to start I’d probably decline but if Novavax isn’t an option by October I might cave and try Pfizer or something. Haha ugh idk!",0.9988,1

We need to define the terms of the genocide that you're referring to. I assume you're claiming that mass vaccinations will go poorly and result in many people dying, right? As of today, we haven't seen any negative side effects affecting people en masse and have no reason to believe such side effects will materialize. The only reasonable concern regarding the vaccine is merely out of an abundance of caution around long term effects. I think you should, right now, set a date by which you think side effects will materialize. If nothing happens by that date, you should reevaluate your opinion that a genocide is occurring.

For the sake of discussion however, let's assume that a genocide is occurring. Who is perpetrating the genocide and who is a merely victim of the genocide? Perpetrating the genocide can be a spectrum ranging from officials that knowingly downplaying the risks associated with the vaccine to officials that are intentionally trying to cause harm. To me, that spectrum of culpability excludes your friends that are subjected to messaging from those officials. They are innocent victims. By cutting them off you are _abandoning_ them.

Billions of dollars of our money was poured into these things as a 'solution' for one to one of the most mild pandemics in the last 100 years. And this was done full-well knowing that there was a very high chance that it would not be ready in time to make any difference. Now even though that it is ready, guess what? By the time it's ready on a large enough scale this virus will be completely done. Burnt out on our own immune systems. Further to this, it is very clear that there is an attempt being made to turn this into an easily repeatable business model by eroding our rights in order to make the vaccine mandatory. Maybe that attempt isn't going to work everywhere but it's obvious that this is what they want. It is also obvious that some of the people pushing these vaccines went out of their way to drive up fear and promote this absolutely medieval and self-destructive medical intervention that we call lockdowns. Literally ruining people's lives because they wanted to make a buck.

Now yes I have my concerns about the potential side-effects of the vaccine and its lack of testing. No I don't think that it makes sense to risk these side-effects for a virus which has a statistically zero chance to kill me (and which I've probably already had). But I admit that you could convince me that they are safe with enough quality data. I don't care still would never take it.",-0.2758,2

On pages 18-19 it talks about a report from the Israel’s People’s Committee. This report is from April 2021.

Showing cases of death: cardiac arrest, heart attacks, strokes, and multi-system failures

It also goes into detail on other issues found: Vaginal bleeding, miscarriage, pregnancy hospitalization, stillbirth, and many more. 

This isn’t pushing a biased narrative it is showing serious issues related to the vaccine and has tons of reports and data to back up its claim.

A main issue is heart issues and blood clotting(pages 24-28). The vaccine is designed to purposely attack proteins so that the body can be able to fight back against it. This however is an issue if it attacks the heart. The heart has an extremely hard time repairing its muscles.

Reports show people being paralyzed(pg61), sudden death(pg56), tremors(pg54), and birth issues such as miscarriages(pg66)

Actually look at what is being shown instead of burying your head in the sand. Many healthcare workers are strongly advising against taking the vaccine(pg60).",-0.4576,14

&gt;But how can someone be against the new normal while voluntarily getting the jab? It's pretty much giving pharmaceutical companies their blessing to implement medical tyranny  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;And it defeats the whole purpose of of fighting back! This is how we lost on masks. Too many people acquiesced, whether they agreed or not, and now we have masks AND vaccines shoved down our throats! The masks are disappearing in some areas, but I don't know if they will ever be completely gone.

All of this right here is my exact point! Being a little bitch and standing up for yourself is exactly what I'm trying to illustrate here! I'm not saying ""Oh stop being a little baby, and just be aggressive because fuck everyone!"" What I'm saying is that the government is trying kill us, control us, in the most disturbing way possible so we need to stand up now before it gets any worse.

Honestly, as a person who has some progressive views, and conservative views. People who stand in the middle are extremely unreliable, because they're too busy trying not to ""offend someone"" and trying to act like they don't care because people can do what they want. 

Well guess what? That right there is exactly why the enemy gets the upper hand. Because of the cowards that refuse to pick a side. Someone is going to get offended, let em die mad about it! I've been a pro-abortion advocate for a long time, and it kills me how each and every time a pro-choice person comes around, you'll notice that immediately they'll act like ""Oh yes we care about women but..."" ""No one's pro-abortion! We just-""

Then what the fuck are you advocating for then!? I always ask myself why do people always feel the need to kiss the asses of the people they hate? Either be for abortion or don't! 

And it's the same here! Either be for the jab, or don't! But there's no in between. Yes there are some scenarios in which call for a gray area. But the scenarios we're in now doesn't! 

Sorry to hurt hearts when I write all this, but all these ""choice"" people, are fucking useless. And all they're doing is ruining what we stand for. If they were truly skeptical, they would never touch the jab in the first place. If they were truly bothered by the world's bs, they wouldn't sit here acting like we should treat it like it's ok for people to be this dumb.

No offense...but I'm starting to feel like we shouldn't allow these people in this sub. It's like saying the abuse is wrong, but they just keep trying to passively justify it by just saying it's their choice. Yes it's your choice, but your choice is wrong, and you know it because you come here all worried.",-0.9868,3

A real killer kills so many people so quickly it wipes itself out if existence. Ebola is an example of that. The only way that this could be maintained is the government continues spraying the engineering virus all over the place. Shipping it in food, putting it in water the whole deal. If that were to be the case humanity would be wiped out. 

Thinking a ton about these Armageddon scenarios causes undo stress, because they’re Armageddon scenarios. There is no solution in that case, the only thing to fear is fear itself. Maybe you’re talking about dialing up the virus a notch but not too much, hitting the sweet spot in terms of being deadly enough to kill many, but not deadly enough that it won’t spread. Fortunately these kinds of things exist already in  where I lived before, Africa, so I understand the mindset of living with a fair risk of mortality. I got malaria and couldn’t walk for several days, had to sleep with an IV drip in my arm, could have been curtains for me. My nephew unfortunately passed away from a flu. We’ve lived with these kinds of diseases throughout history, and totalitarian governments won’t be able to get rid of dissidents through a virus alone. They’ll ultimately have to kill us directly. 

Critical thinking is important and the more I think about the super-virus possibility, the more I believe it would be a very controlled operation rather than a doomsday scenario. Since a doomsday scenario could very well wipe out the elites themselves. The way to bring this out in a controlled manner is to make us weaker, not the virus stronger. Which is what they are already doing with the garbage in our food, water, and environment. I feel the “vaccine” may be a big proponent in this hence why they want to give it out so often, and why it makes so many people sick immediately after taking it. So right now we do have situations to fight back against, to prevent any extreme situations which cause anxiety to think about. I feel our energy is best focused on fighting what we have now rather than being afraid of what could be. We won’t even have to cross that bridge when we come to it if we prevent any such scenario from ever occurring.

And I believe due to the rush nature of the vaccine, it was granted special protection from lawsuits saying the vaccine producers could not be sued because the vaccine was so important.  So even if the vaccine killed 100% of the people who received it, there would be no legal recourse.

Still 20k seems like at least twice too high. This is caused by overregulation which leads to a messed up ""free"" market that is dominated by parties that were able to take the hit of the costs to entry or were able to introduce the regulation to raise the bar to entry.

US got high prices because they wanted to make everything them self. Thats not our problem!They left all tradedeals so ofcause we put tarrifs on stuff US import! ? US does the same to us! In Europe we pay like 500 to 1000 dollars/Euro for a motorized wheelchair because we import it rather then build it our self. (if its not specially build etc)

&gt;We have been stuck at home this winter and spring for the fucking healthcare system to not shit itself. Do not get me started about this wonderful healthcare system somewhere else in the world.

I’m not going to subject myself to a 0.0017 chance of death from the vaccine to avoid the exceptionally rare circumstance of me catching Covid the same week I move into my grandads retirement village.

I really feel like I'm beginning to understand you. I don't think you're unintelligent or belligerent. In fact, I might have some family members and friends that are not so different from yourself. But I do not mean to pigeonhole you in any way. I think medicine and health will always present a moving target, and that is truly frustrating. And I think more dire situations will often cause the first several shots to go wide. You have to understand that everything we know is only based on best estimation. That's the unfortunate nature of science. We'll get it wrong, try again, and land a little closer to the truth.

I'm a New Yorker, and I live in Manhattan. My neighborhood is actually the epicenter of the rise of one of the new variants. My building is home to many elderly people with whom I interact daily (as safely as possible). This is to say that my experience may be very different from your own--fewer places have higher population density. You are likely correct to assume that the measures that are necessary in my neighborhood are not necessary in a common suburban neighborhood. But then do we really expect our leaders to develop tailored guidelines for every single situation? The infographic that you shared seems in line with most recommendations, minus frequent mask usage. I imagine following that is perfectly sufficient in many areas.

I guess in closing, I would just implore you to not discredit our country's experts for making corrections on their own work. And as Americans, I think we both understand that our leaders are not really leaders for their qualities of leadership, but more for their qualities in fund raising and being born into powerful families. But don't conflate the failures of our leaders with the corrections of our experts. Again, I trust the scientific community. And they don't speak through Fauci, but rather through the papers they publish. Even a cursory review of those reveals their consensus: practice social distancing and wear your mask.

But listen man I don't think I'm going to sway you. I just hope you and your family can make it through this thing unharmed and OK. And you probably will.",0.9928,1

Across provincial (Canadian) and national borders. I've traveled interprovincially pretty well as per usual since the start of all this.  


During all that time and through all of those interactions, I have met ONE customer who actually had the coof. He was in his early 40's. Described it as a ""kind of bad"" cold that affected him for a couple of days. He recovered on his own and hasn't had any issues since. I've heard various secondhand tales of so-and-so's uncle or fourth cousin who had it. Nobody in my sphere of family (extended included), friends, or regular customers has died ""with"" or ""from"" (lol) COVID. And I have gone out of my way to inquire about this, too.  


Now maybe I'm just defying the odds? I do have the devil's own luck, after all. But maybe, given the numbers, the odds are actually greater that any given individual won't know anyone who has contracted the virus, let alone died from it.

I'll go there for you.

&gt; Investigations into breakthrough cases use a PCR cycle threshold of &lt;= 28

As far as what I've seen around covid19, it's the latter that has driven government lockdown decisions. Not the raw numbers, but the spin.

What I've seen from the ""we will have to continue this stuff forever"" crowd is the assumption that the vaccine won't be 100% effective, as flu shots are not 100% effective against the flu now. What then?

Aside from worries about the future: there is ample evidence already to show that lockdowns are causing serious harm to people right now. You want to treat those harms as inevitable and the deaths from covid19 as worth preventing whatever the cost, leaving debate about lockdown costs to some point in the indefinite future when we get a vaccine that totally fixes the covid19 problem. At bottom, this isn't an argument against present vs future costs, but an argument against which deaths and health problems should be seen as something worth prioritizing the fight against, and which should be seen as unfortunately necessary casualties of how we organize our society.

Fauci even published that the death rate from covid was 'in the region of a strong flu' in an article in the New England Medical Journal right at the beginning of this farce.  He stated that people shouldn't wear masks in a TV interview that is easily accessible on YouTube.  The issue is, that I spent many months reading the literature on this back in March to May as well as the early serological studies that started showing what we suspected all along was in fact, true - everytime it happened and we had a new piece of evidence, I expected the media messaging to change and the whole thing to be called the idiotic mistake that it is, when it didn't though, I just gave up caring actually sourcing or proving anything because it makes literally zero difference.  Asymptomatic spread has been disproven by a huge study involving 10 million people.  IFR is between 0.1 and 0.3% or possibly even lower.  The virus is barely a threat to anyone who isn't already very old and very ill.  The way covid deaths are counted is illogical and makes for terrible data and massive overcounting.  PCR testing is incredibly unreliable.  Masks don't work.  Lockdowns don't work.  Lockdowns have terrible impacts on the economies, livelihoods, mental and physical health of not just the countries they are implemented in but the wider world as well that will cause more damage than the virus ever could have.

&gt;The Milgram experiment(s) on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram.  
 They measured the willingness of study participants, men from a diverse  
 range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience.  
 Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated   
experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a   
""learner"". These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that  
 would have been fatal had they been real.
