"@TheShane73 @projecthalo Very true and best protected by a vaccine is the best protection apart from closing borders and testing and quarantining at the borders and not letting covid 19 fast mutating viruses in ,in the first place."
@Marley_Mae_1 I was flippant. The vaccine jacks with your immune system. At best it only lasts 6 months. The mRNA vaccines are different than traditional vax that inject a live or dead virus. The mRNA tells gets the body to spike proteins causing the immune system to respond and attack them.
"@maxinevaccine2 The vaccines should never have been politicized nor continue to be, by all in volved. The divide here is between freedom and safety. I don't think the risk is great enough to take freedoms. It seems there's nothing you won't do for every protection, at cost of personal freedom."
@IrfanDhalla Do all vaccine types carry the same risk of myocarditis? I don't believe the whole inactivated have shown the same signal as the mRNA ones. Perhaps a more strategic approach that stratifies risk/benefit for different types of vaccines for different cohorts needs to be considered

"So, on 31st August ‚Äò21, India creates a record of 1,30,84,344 vaccines in a single day, proving umpteen people wrong but more than that, boosting the confidence of Nation, saluting all the scientists and #covidwarriors &amp; citizens who are united in this #FightAgainstCOVID19  https://t.co/34EjQHb0tm"

@sfpelosi @Rschooley I can hear the Federalist Society‚Äôs champaign corks starting to pop
@caslernoel Many of those vaccines and medicine used on animals do not have full FDA approval
@chaseyb @mitchpberg @DanRather To quote @HamptonStevens ‚Äúthe real flaw is that eliminating choice around abortion means forcing women to give birth while eliminating choice around vaccines means preventing the spread and mutation of a deadly airborne illness. It's a preposterous comparison.‚Äù
